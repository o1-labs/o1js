# Purpose:
# This workflow automatically attempts to merge changes from the 'main' branch into the 'v2' branch
# whenever changes are pushed to 'main'. If the automatic merge fails due to conflicts, it creates
# a pull request for manual resolution.
#
# Workflow Details:
# 1. Triggered on every push to the 'main' branch.
# 2. Checks out the repository with full history.
# 3. Configures Git with GitHub Actions bot credentials.
# 4. Attempts to merge 'main' into 'v2' and push the result.
# 5. If merge fails, creates a pull request for manual conflict resolution.
