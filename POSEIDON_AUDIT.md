# CRITICAL: Poseidon Implementation Audit

**Date**: January 6, 2025  
**Status**: ❌ COMPLETELY BROKEN - DO NOT USE

## Executive Summary

The current Poseidon implementation in Sparky is **NOT a cryptographic hash function**. It's a dangerous stub that simply adds the first input to each state element. This provides **ZERO security** and must not be used in any production or security-sensitive context.

## What's Currently Implemented

```rust
// From sparky-wasm/src/poseidon.rs
// Simplified constraint: output[i] = state[i] + input[0]
compiler.assert_add(state_vars[i], input_vars[0], output_vars[i])
```

This is just arithmetic addition, not a hash function.

## What Poseidon Actually Requires

1. **Permutation Structure**
   - 55 rounds (full rounds + partial rounds)
   - Each round includes:
     - S-box: x^7 (or x^5/x^3 depending on field)
     - Linear layer: MDS matrix multiplication
     - Round constants addition

2. **Sponge Construction**
   - Absorption phase: XOR (field addition) inputs into state
   - Permutation application
   - Squeezing phase: extract output

3. **Constraint Generation**
   - Snarky generates 11 specialized `Poseidon` gates
   - Current Sparky generates 3-6 `Generic` gates
   - Gate type mismatch means VK incompatibility

## Security Impact

Using this implementation would result in:
- **No collision resistance**: Many inputs produce same output
- **Predictable outputs**: output = state + input[0]
- **No avalanche effect**: Small changes = small output changes
- **Complete compromise** of any system relying on it

## Required Actions

### Option 1: Implement Real Poseidon (Recommended)
1. Create `assert_poseidon()` method in constraint compiler
2. Generate proper `Poseidon` gate types
3. Implement the full permutation with proper parameters
4. Match Snarky's constraint generation pattern

### Option 2: Fail Explicitly (Temporary)
```rust
pub fn update(&self, state: JsValue, input: JsValue) -> Result<JsValue, JsValue> {
    Err(js_sys::Error::new(
        "Poseidon is not yet implemented in Sparky. \
         Current code is a non-secure stub for testing only."
    ).into())
}
```

### Option 3: Bridge to Existing Implementation
If there's a working Poseidon in the codebase, bridge to it instead of reimplementing.

## Testing Requirements

Before claiming Poseidon works:
1. **Test vectors**: Output must match known Poseidon test vectors
2. **Cross-backend parity**: Same inputs must produce same outputs as Snarky
3. **Constraint compatibility**: Must generate same gate types as Snarky
4. **Security properties**: Collision resistance, avalanche effect

## Conclusion

**DO NOT USE THIS IMPLEMENTATION FOR ANYTHING SECURITY-RELATED**

The current code is a placeholder that was clearly marked with TODO comments but is dangerous because it appears to work while providing no security whatsoever. This must be either properly implemented or made to fail explicitly.
