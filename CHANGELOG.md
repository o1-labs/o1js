## [Unreleased](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/compare/f0837188...HEAD)

### Added

- Added an optional string parameter to certain `assert` methods https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/470
- `Struct`, a new primitive for declaring composite, SNARK-compatible types https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/416
  - With this, we also added a way to include auxiliary, non-field element data in composite types
  - Added `VerificationKey`, which is a `Struct` with auxiliary data, to pass verification keys to a `@method`
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Change names related to circuit types: `AsFieldsAndAux<T>` -> `Provable<T>`, `AsFieldElement<T>` -> `ProvablePure<T>`, `circuitValue` -> `provable`
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Change all `ofFields` and `ofBits` methods on circuit types to `fromFields` and `fromBits`
- `SmartContract.experimental.authorize()` to authorize a tree of child account updates https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/428
  - AccountUpdates are now valid `@method` arguments, and `authorize()` is intended to be used on them when passed to a method
  - Also replaces `Experimental.accountUpdateFromCallback()`
- `Circuit.log()` to easily log Fields and other provable types inside a method, with the same API as `console.log()`
- `AccountUpdate.attachToTransaction()` for explicitly adding an account update to the current transaction. This replaces some previous behaviour where an account update got attached implicitly.

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: `tx.send()` is now asynchronous: old: `send(): TransactionId` new: `send(): Promise<TransactionId>` and `tx.send()` now directly waits for the network response, as opposed to `tx.send().wait()`
- `Circuit.witness` can now be called outside circuits, where it will just directly return the callback result

### Deprecated

- `CircuitValue` deprecated in favor of `Struct` https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/416

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/compare/ba688523...f0837188)

### Fixed

- Proof verification on the web version https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/476
- Callback arguments are properly passed into method invocations https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/516

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/compare/f2ad423...ba688523)

### Added

- `reducer.getActions` partially implemented for local testing https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/327
- `gte` and `assertGte` methods on `UInt32`, `UInt64` https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/349
- Return sent transaction `hash` for `RemoteBlockchain` https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/399

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: Rename the `Party` class to `AccountUpdate`. Also, rename other occurrences of "party" to "account update". https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/393
- BREAKING CHANGE: Don't require the account address as input to `SmartContract.compile()`, `SmartContract.digest()` and `SmartContract.analyzeMethods()` https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/406
  - This works because the address / public key is now a variable in the method circuit; it used to be a constant
- BREAKING CHANGE: Move `ZkProgram` to `Experimental.ZkProgram`

## [0.5.4](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/compare/3461333...f2ad423)

### Fixed

## [0.5.3](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/compare/4f0dd40...3461333)

### Fixed

- Infinite loop when compiling in web version https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/379, by @maht0rz

## [0.5.2](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/compare/55c8ea0...4f0dd40)

### Fixed

- Crash of the web version introduced in 0.5.0
- Issue with `Experimental.MerkleWitness` https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/368

## [0.5.1](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/compare/e0192f7...55c8ea0)

### Fixed

- `fetchAccount` https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/350

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/compare/2375f08...e0192f7)

### Added

- **Recursive proofs**. RFC: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/89, PRs: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/245 https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/250 https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/261
  - Enable smart contract methods to take previous proofs as arguments, and verify them in the circuit
  - Add `ZkProgram`, a new primitive which represents a collection of circuits that produce instances of the same proof. So, it's a more general version of `SmartContract`, without any of the Mina-related API.  
    `ZkProgram` is suitable for rollup-type systems and offchain usage of Pickles + Kimchi.
- **zkApp composability** -- calling other zkApps from inside zkApps. RFC: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/303, PRs: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/285, https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/296, https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/294, https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/297
- **Events** support via `SmartContract.events`, `this.emitEvent`. RFC: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/248, PR: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/272
  - `fetchEvents` partially implemented for local testing: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/323
- **Payments**: `this.send({ to, amount })` as an easier API for sending Mina from smart contracts https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/325
  - `Party.send()` to transfer Mina between any accounts, for example, from users to smart contracts
- `SmartContract.digest()` to quickly compute a hash of the contract's circuit. This is [used by the zkApp CLI](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/pull/233) to figure out whether `compile` should be re-run or a cached verification key can be used. https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/268
- `Circuit.constraintSystem()` for creating a circuit from a function, counting the number of constraints and computing a digest of the circuit https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/279
- `this.account.isNew` to assert that an account did not (or did) exist before the transaction https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11524
- `LocalBlockchain.setTimestamp` and other setters for network state, to test network preconditions locally https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/329
- **Experimental APIs** are now collected under the `Experimental` import, or on `this.experimental` in a smart contract.
- Custom tokens (_experimental_), via `this.experimental.token`. RFC: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/233, PR: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/273,
- Actions / sequence events support (_experimental_), via `Experimental.Reducer`. RFC: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/265, PR: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/274
- Merkle tree implementation (_experimental_) via `Experimental.MerkleTree` https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/343

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: Make on-chain state consistent with other preconditions - throw an error when state is not explicitly constrained https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/267
- `CircuitValue` improvements https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/269, https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/306, https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/341
  - Added a base constructor, so overriding the constructor on classes that extend `CircuitValue` is now _optional_. When overriding, the base constructor can be called without arguments, as previously: `super()`. When not overriding, the expected arguments are all the `@prop`s on the class, in the order they were defined in: `new MyCircuitValue(prop1, prop2)`.
  - `CircuitValue.fromObject({ prop1, prop2 })` is a new, better-typed alternative for using the base constructor.
  - Fixed: the overridden constructor is now free to have any argument structure -- previously, arguments had to be the props in their declared order. I.e., the behaviour that's now used by the base constructor used to be forced on all constructors, which is no longer the case.
- `Mina.transaction` improvements
  - Support zkApp proofs when there are other account updates in the same transaction block https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/280
  - Support multiple independent zkApp proofs in one transaction block https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/296
- Add previously unimplemented preconditions, like `this.network.timestamp` https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/324 https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11577
- Improve error messages thrown from Wasm, by making Rust's `panic` log to the JS console https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11644
- Not user-facing, but essential: Smart contracts fully constrain the account updates they create, inside the circuit https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/278

### Fixed

- Fix comparisons on `UInt32` and `UInt64` (`UInt32.lt`, `UInt32.gt`, etc) https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/174, https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/101. PR: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/307

## [0.4.3](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/compare/e66f08d...2375f08)

### Added

- Implement the [precondition RFC](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/179#issuecomment-1139413831):
  - new fields `this.account` and `this.network` on both `SmartContract` and `Party`
  - `this.<account|network>.<property>.get()` to use on-chain values in a circuit, e.g. account balance or block height
  - `this.<account|network>.<property>.{assertEqual, assertBetween, assertNothing}()` to constrain what values to allow for these
- `CircuitString`, a snark-compatible string type with methods like `.append()` https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/155
- `bool.assertTrue()`, `bool.assertFalse()` as convenient aliases for existing functionality
- `Ledger.verifyPartyProof` which can check if a proof on a transaction is valid https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/208
- Memo field in APIs like `Mina.transaction` to attach arbitrary messages https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/pull/244
- This changelog

### Changed

- Huge snark performance improvements (2-10x) for most zkApps https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11053
- Performance improvements in node with > 4 CPUs, for all snarks https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11292
- Substantial reduction of snarkyjs' size https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11166

### Removed

- Unused functions `call` and `callUnproved`, which were embryonic versions of what is now the `transaction` API to call smart contract methods
- Some unimplemented fields on `SmartContract`

### Fixed

- zkApp proving on web https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/226
