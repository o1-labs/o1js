- Fixed the static `check()` method in Struct classes to properly handle inheritance, preventing issues with under-constrained circuits. Added error handling to avoid using Struct directly as a field type. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1707
- Fixed that `Option` could not be used as `@state` or event https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1736

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/40c597775...ed198f305) - 2024-06-25

### Added

- **SHA256 low-level API** exposed via `Gadgets.SHA256`. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1689 [@Shigoto-dev19](https://github.com/Shigoto-dev19)

### Deprecated

- `Int64.isPositive()` and `Int64.mod()` deprecated because they behave incorrectly on `-0` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1660
  - This can pose an attack surface, since it is easy to maliciously pick either the `+0` or the `-0` representation
  - Use `Int64.isPositiveV2()` and `Int64.modV2()` instead
  - Also deprecated `Int64.neg()` in favor of `Int64.negV2()`, for compatibility with v2 version of `Int64` that will use `Int64.checkV2()`
- `Ecdsa.verify()` and `Ecdsa.verifySignedHash()` deprecated in favor of `Ecdsa.verifyV2()` and `Ecdsa.verifySignedHashV2()` due to a security vulnerability found in the current implementation https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1669

### Fixed

- Fix handling of fetch response for non-existing accounts https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1679

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/4a17de857...6a1012162) - 2024-05-14

### Added

- **Offchain state MVP** exported under `Experimental.OffchainState` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1630 https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1652
  - allows you to store any number of fields and key-value maps on your zkApp
  - implemented using actions which define an offchain Merkle tree
- `Option` for defining an optional version of any provable type https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1630

- `Permissions.VerificationKey`, a namespace for verification key permissions https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1639
  - Includes more accurate names for the `impossible` and `proof` permissions for verification keys, which are now called `impossibleDuringCurrentVersion` and `proofDuringCurrentVersion` respectively.

### Changed

- `State()` now optionally accepts an initial value as input parameter https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1630
  - Example: `@state(Field) x = State(Field(1));`
  - Initial values will be set in the default `init()` method
  - You no longer need a custom `init()` method to set initial values

### Fixes

- Fix absolute imports which prevented compilation in some TS projects that used o1js https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1628

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/1ad7333e9e...4a17de857) - 2024-04-30

### Added

- Exposed **sideloaded verification keys** https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1606 [@rpanic](https://github.com/rpanic)

- Example for implementing RSA verification in o1js https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1229 [@Shigoto-dev19](https://github.com/Shigoto-dev19)
  - Check out https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/main/src/examples/crypto/rsa/rsa.ts and tests in the same folder

### Changed

- `Gadgets.rangeCheck64()` now returns individual range-checked limbs for advanced use cases https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1229

### Fixed

- Fixed issue in `UInt64.rightShift()` where it incorrectly performed a left shift instead of a right shift. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1617
- Fixed issue in `ForeignField.toBits()` where high limbs were under-constrained for input length less than 176. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1617
- Make `dummyBase64Proof()` lazy. Significant speed up when generating many account updates with authorization `Proof` while proofs turned off. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1624

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/1b6fd8b8e...02c5e8d4d) - 2024-04-22

### Breaking changes

- Native curve improvements https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1530
  - Change the internal representation of `Scalar` from 255 Bools to 1 Bool and 1 Field (low bit and high 254 bits)
  - Make `Group.scale()` support all scalars (previously did not support 0, 1 and -1)
  - Make `Group.scale()` directly accept `Field` elements, and much more efficient than previous methods of scaling by Fields
    - As a result, `Signature.verify()` and `Nullifier.verify()` use much fewer constraints
  - Fix `Scalar.fromBits()` to not produce a shifted scalar; shifting is no longer exposed to users of `Scalar`.
- Add assertion to the foreign EC addition gadget that prevents degenerate cases https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1545
  - Fixes soundness of ECDSA; slightly increases its constraints from ~28k to 29k
  - Breaks circuits that used EC addition, like ECDSA
- `Mina.LocalBlockchain()` and `Proof.fromJSON()` are made async https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1583
  - These were the last remaining sync APIs that depended on an async setup task; making them async enables removing top-level await
- `Mina.LocalBlockchain` no longer supports the network kind configuration https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1581
- `Poseidon.hashToGroup()` now returns a `Group` directly, and constrains it to be deterministic https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1546
  - Added `Poseidon.Unsafe.hashToGroup()` as a more efficient, non-deterministic version for advanced use cases
- A `Transaction`'s `prove` method no longer returns the proofs promise directly, but rather returns a `Transaction` promise, the resolved value of which contains a `proofs` prop. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1567
- The `Transaction` type now has two type params `Proven extends boolean` and `Signed extends boolean`, which are used to conditionally show/hide relevant state. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1567
- Improved functionality of `MerkleList` and `MerkleListIterator` for easier traversal of `MerkleList`s. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1562
- Simplified internal logic of reducer. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1577
  - `contract.getActions()` now returns a `MerkleList`
- Add `toValue()` and `fromValue()` interface to `Provable<T>` to encode how provable types map to plain JS values https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1271
  - You can now return the plain value from a `Provable.witness()` callback, and it will be transformed into the provable type
- Remove `Account()` constructor which was no different from `AccountUpdate.create().account`, and export `Account` type instead. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1598

### Added

- Export `Events` under `AccountUpdate.Events`. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1563
- `Mina.transaction` has been reworked such that one can call methods directly on the returned promise (now a `TransactionPromise`). This enables a fluent / method-chaining API. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1567
- `TransactionPendingPromise` enables calling `wait` directly on the promise returned by calling `send` on a `Transaction`. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1567
- `initializeBindings()` to explicitly trigger setup work that is needed when running provable code https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1583
  - calling this function is optional

### Changed

- Remove top-level await https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1583
  - To simplify integration with bundlers like webpack
- Make `MerkleTree.{nodes,zeroes}` public properties https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1555
  - This makes it possible to clone merkle trees, which is often needed

### Fixed

- Fix error when computing Merkle map witnesses, introduced in the last version due to the `toBits()` change https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1559
- Improved error message when compiling a program that has no methods. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1563

## [0.18.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/74948acac...1b6fd8b8e) - 2024-04-09

### Breaking changes

- **Async circuits**. Require all smart contract and zkprogram methods to be async https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1477
  - This change allows you to use `await` inside your methods. Change the method signature by adding the `async` keyword.
  - Don't forget to add `await` to all contract calls! `await MyContract.myMethod();`
  - To declare a return value from a method, use the new `@method.returns()` decorator
- Require the callback to `Mina.transaction()` to be async https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1468
- Change `{SmartContract,ZkProgram}.analyzeMethods()` to be async https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1450
  - `Provable.runAndCheck()`, `Provable.constraintSystem()` and `{SmartContract,ZkProgram}.digest()` are also async now
- **Remove deprecated APIs**
  - Remove `CircuitValue`, `prop`, `arrayProp` and `matrixProp` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1507
  - Remove `Mina.accountCreationFee()`, `Mina.BerkeleyQANet`, all APIs which accept private keys for feepayers, `Token`, `AccountUpdate.tokenSymbol`, `SmartContract.{token, setValue, setPermissions}`, "assert" methods for preconditions, `MerkleTee.calculateRootSlow()`, `Scalar.fromBigInt()`, `UInt64.lt()` and friends, deprecated static methods on `Group`, utility methods on `Circuit` like `Circuit.if()`, `Field.isZero()`, `isReady` and `shutdown()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1515
- Remove `privateKey` from the accepted arguments of `SmartContract.deploy()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1515
- **Efficient comparisons**. Support arbitrary bit lengths for `Field` comparisons and massively reduce their constraints https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1523
  - `Field.assertLessThan()` goes from 510 to 24 constraints, `Field.lessThan()` from 509 to 38
  - Moderately improve other comparisons: `UInt64.assertLessThan()` from 27 to 14, `UInt64.lessThan()` from 27 to 15, `UInt32` similar.
  - Massively improve `Field.isEven()`, add `Field.isOdd()`
  - `PrivateKey.toPublicKey()` from 358 to 119 constraints thanks to `isOdd()`
  - Add `Gadgets.ForeignField.assertLessThanOrEqual()` and support two variables as input to `ForeignField.assertLessThan()`
- Remove `this.sender` which unintuitively did not prove that its value was the actual sender of the transaction https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1464 [@julio4](https://github.com/julio4)
  Replaced by more explicit APIs:
  - `this.sender.getUnconstrained()` which has the old behavior of `this.sender`, and returns an unconstrained value (which means that the prover can set it to any value they want)
  - `this.sender.getAndRequireSignature()` which requires a signature from the sender's public key and therefore proves that whoever created the transaction really owns the sender account
- `Reducer.reduce()` requires the maximum number of actions per method as an explicit (optional) argument https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1450
  - The default value is 1 and should work for most existing contracts
- `new UInt64()` and `UInt64.from()` no longer unsafely accept a field element as input. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1438 [@julio4](https://github.com/julio4)  
   As a replacement, `UInt64.Unsafe.fromField()` was introduced
  - This prevents you from accidentally creating a `UInt64` without proving that it fits in 64 bits
  - Equivalent changes were made to `UInt32`
- Fixed vulnerability in `Field.to/fromBits()` outlined in [#1023](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/1023) by imposing a limit of 254 bits https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1461
- Remove `Field.rangeCheckHelper()` which was too low-level and easy to misuse https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1485
  - Also, rename the misleadingly named `Gadgets.isInRangeN()` to `Gadgets.isDefinitelyInRangeN()`
- Rename `Bool.Unsafe.ofField()` to `Bool.Unsafe.fromField()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1485
- Replace the namespaced type exports `Gadgets.Field3` and `Gadgets.ForeignField.Sum` with `Field3` and `ForeignFieldSum`
  - Unfortunately, the namespace didn't play well with auto-imports in TypeScript
- Add `Gadgets.rangeCheck3x12()` and fix proof system bug that prevented it from working https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1534
- Update transaction version and other bindings changes to ensure berkeley compatibility https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1542

### Added

- `Provable.witnessAsync()` to introduce provable values from an async callback https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1468
- Internal benchmarking tooling to keep track of performance https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1481
- Add `toInput` method for `Group` instance https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1483

### Changed

- `field.assertBool()` now also returns the `Field` as a `Bool` for ergonomics https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1523

## [0.17.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/1ad7333e9e...74948acac) - 2024-03-06

### Breaking changes

- Fixed parity between `Mina.LocalBlockchain` and `Mina.Network` to have the same behaviors https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1422 https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1480
  - Changed the `TransactionId` type to `Transaction`. Additionally added `PendingTransaction` and `RejectedTransaction` types to better represent the state of a transaction.
  - `Transaction.safeSend()` and `PendingTransaction.safeWait()` are introduced to return a `IncludedTransaction` or `RejectedTransaction` object without throwing errors.
  - `transaction.send()` throws an error if the transaction was not successful for both `Mina.LocalBlockchain` and `Mina.Network` and returns a `PendingTransaction` object if it was successful. Use `transaction.safeSend` to send a transaction that will not throw an error and either return a `PendingTransaction` or `RejectedTransaction`.
  - `transaction.wait()` throws an error if the transaction was not successful for both `Mina.LocalBlockchain` and `Mina.Network` and returns a `IncludedTransaction` object if it was successful. Use `transaction.safeWait` to send a transaction that will not throw an error and either return a `IncludedTransaction` or `RejectedTransaction`.
  - `transaction.hash()` is no longer a function, it is now a property that returns the hash of the transaction.
  - Changed `Transaction.isSuccess` to `Transaction.status` to better represent the state of a transaction.
- Improved efficiency of computing `AccountUpdate.callData` by packing field elements into as few field elements as possible https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1458
  - This leads to a large reduction in the number of constraints used when inputs to a zkApp method are many field elements (e.g. a long list of `Bool`s)
- Return events in the `LocalBlockchain` in reverse chronological order (latest events at the beginning) to match the behavior of the `Network` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1460

### Added

- Support for custom network identifiers other than `mainnet` or `testnet` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1444
- `PrivateKey.randomKeypair()` to generate private and public key in one command https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1446
- `setNumberOfWorkers()` to allow developer to override the number of workers used during compilation and proof generation/verification https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1456

### Changed

- Improve all-around performance by reverting the Apple silicon workaround (https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/683) as the root problem is now fixed upstream https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1456
- Improved error message when trying to use `fetchActions`/`fetchEvents` with a missing Archive Node endpoint https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1459

### Deprecated

- `SmartContract.token` is deprecated in favor of new methods on `TokenContract` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1446
  - `TokenContract.deriveTokenId()` to get the ID of the managed token
  - `TokenContract.internal.{send, mint, burn}` to perform token operations from within the contract

### Fixed

- Mitigate security hazard of deploying token contracts https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/1439

### Added

- Added a method `createTestNullifier` to the Nullifier class for testing purposes. It is recommended to use mina-signer to create Nullifiers in production, since it does not leak the private key of the user. The `Nullifier.createTestNullifier` method requires the private key as an input _outside of the users wallet_. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1026
- Added `field.isEven` to check if a Field element is odd or even. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1026

## [0.10.1](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/bcc666f2...a632313a)

### Changed

- Allow ZkPrograms to return their public output https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/874 https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/876
  - new option `ZkProgram({ publicOutput?: Provable<any>, ... })`; `publicOutput` has to match the _return type_ of all ZkProgram methods.
  - the `publicInput` option becomes optional; if not provided, methods no longer expect the public input as first argument
  - full usage example: https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/f95cf2903e97292df9e703b74ee1fc3825df826d/src/examples/program.ts

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/97e393ed...bcc666f2)

### Breaking Changes

- All references to `actionsHash` are renamed to `actionState` to better mirror what is used in Mina protocol APIs https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/833
  - This change affects function parameters and returned object keys throughout the API

- Add `Permissions.allImpossible()` for the set of permissions where nothing is allowed (more convenient than `Permissions.default()` when you want to make most actions impossible) https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/863

### Changed

- **Massive improvement of memory consumption**, thanks to a refactor of o1js' worker usage https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/872

- Token APIs `this.token.{send,burn,mint}()` now accept an `AccountUpdate` or `SmartContract` as from / to input https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/863
- Improve `Transaction.toPretty()` output by adding account update labels in most methods that create account updates https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/863
- Raises the limit of actions/events per transaction from 16 to 100, providing users with the ability to submit a larger number of events/actions in a single transaction. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/883.

### Deprecated

- Deprecate both `shutdown()` and `await isReady`, which are no longer needed https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/872

### Fixed

- `SmartContract.deploy()` now throws an error when no verification key is found https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/885
  - The old, confusing behaviour was to silently not update the verification key (but still update some permissions to "proof", breaking the zkApp)

## [0.9.8](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/1a984089...97e393ed)

### Fixed

- Fix fetching the `access` permission on accounts https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/851
- Fix `fetchActions` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/844 https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/854 [@Comdex](https://github.com/Comdex)
- Updated `Mina.TransactionId.isSuccess` to accurately verify zkApp transaction status after using `Mina.TransactionId.wait()`. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/826
  - This change ensures that the function correctly checks for transaction completion and provides the expected result.

## [0.9.7](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/0b7a9ad...1a984089)

### Added

- `smartContract.fetchActions()` and `Mina.fetchActions()`, asynchronous methods to fetch actions directly from an archive node https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/843 [@Comdex](https://github.com/Comdex)

### Changed

- `Circuit.runAndCheck()` now uses `snarky` to create a constraint system and witnesses, and check constraints. It closely matches behavior during proving and can be used to test provable code without having to create an expensive proof https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/840

### Fixed

- Fixes two issues that were temporarily reintroduced in the 0.9.6 release https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/799 https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/530

## [0.9.6](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/21de489...0b7a9ad)

### Breaking changes

- Circuits changed due to an internal rename of "sequence events" to "actions" which included a change to some hash prefixes; this breaks all deployed contracts.
- Temporarily reintroduces 2 known issues as a result of reverting a fix necessary for network redeployment:
  - https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/799
  - https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/530
  - Please note that we plan to address these issues in a future release. In the meantime, to work around this breaking change, you can try calling `fetchAccount` for each account involved in a transaction before executing the `Mina.transaction` block.
- Improve number of constraints needed for Merkle tree hashing https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/820
  - This breaks deployed zkApps which use `MerkleWitness.calculateRoot()`, because the circuit is changed
  - You can make your existing contracts compatible again by switching to `MerkleWitness.calculateRootSlow()`, which has the old circuit
- Renamed function parameters: The `getAction` function now accepts a new object structure for its parameters. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/828
  - The previous object keys, `fromActionHash` and `endActionHash`, have been replaced by `fromActionState` and `endActionState`.

### Added

- `zkProgram.analyzeMethods()` to obtain metadata about a ZkProgram's methods https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/829 [@maht0rz](https://github.com/maht0rz)

### Fixed

- Improved Event Handling in o1js https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/825
  - Updated the internal event type to better handle events emitted in different zkApp transactions and when multiple zkApp transactions are present within a block.
  - The internal event type now includes event data and transaction information as separate objects, allowing for more accurate information about each event and its associated transaction.
- Removed multiple best tip blocks when fetching action data https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/817
  - Implemented a temporary fix that filters out multiple best tip blocks, if they exist, while fetching actions. This fix will be removed once the related issue in the Archive-Node-API repository (https://github.com/o1-labs/Archive-Node-API/issues/7) is resolved.
- New `fromActionState` and `endActionState` parameters for fetchActions function in o1js https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/828
  - Allows fetching only necessary actions to compute the latest actions state
  - Eliminates the need to retrieve the entire actions history of a zkApp
  - Utilizes `actionStateTwo` field returned by Archive Node API as a safe starting point for deriving the most recent action hash

## [0.9.5](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/21de489...4573252d)

- Update the zkApp verification key from within one of its own methods, via proof https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/812

### Breaking changes

- Change type of verification key returned by `SmartContract.compile()` to match `VerificationKey` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/812

### Fixed

- Failing `Mina.transaction` on Berkeley because of unsatisfied constraints caused by dummy data before we fetched account state https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/807
  - Previously, you could work around this by calling `fetchAccount()` for every account invovled in a transaction. This is not necessary anymore.
- Update the zkApp verification key from within one of its own methods, via proof https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/812

## [0.9.4](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/9acec55...21de489)

### Fixed

- `getActions` to handle multiple actions with multiple Account Updates https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/801

## [0.9.3](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/1abdfb70...9acec55)

### Added

- Use `fetchEvents()` to fetch events for a specified zkApp from a GraphQL endpoint that implements [this schema](https://github.com/o1-labs/Archive-Node-API/blob/efebc9fd3cfc028f536ae2125e0d2676e2b86cd2/src/schema.ts#L1). `Mina.Network` accepts an additional endpoint which points to a GraphQL server. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/749
  - Use the `mina` property for the Mina node.
  - Use `archive` for the archive node.
- Use `getActions` to fetch actions for a specified zkApp from a GraphQL endpoint GraphQL endpoint that implements the same schema as `fetchEvents`. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/788

### Fixed

- Added the missing export of `Mina.TransactionId` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/785
- Added an option to specify `tokenId` as `Field` in `fetchAccount()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/787 [@rpanic](https://github.com/rpanic)

## [0.9.2](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/9c44b9c2...1abdfb70)

### Added

- `this.network.timestamp` is added back and is implemented on top of `this.network.globalSlotSinceGenesis` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/755

### Changed

- On-chain value `globalSlot` is replaced by the clearer `currentSlot` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/755
  - `currentSlot` refers to the slot at which the transaction _will be included in a block_.
  - the only supported method is `currentSlot.assertBetween()` because `currentSlot.get()` is impossible to implement since the value is determined in the future and `currentSlot.assertEquals()` is error-prone

### Fixed

- Incorrect counting of limit on events and actions https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/758
- Type error when using `Circuit.array` in on-chain state or events https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/758
- Bug when using `Circuit.witness` outside the prover https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/774

## [0.9.1](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/71b6132b...9c44b9c2)

### Fixed

- Bug when using `this.<state>.get()` outside a transaction https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/754

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/c5a36207...71b6132b)

### Added

- `Transaction.fromJSON` to recover transaction object from JSON https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/705
- New precondition: `provedState`, a boolean which is true if the entire on-chain state of this account was last modified by a proof https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/741
  - Same API as all preconditions: `this.account.provedState.assertEquals(Bool(true))`
  - Can be used to assert that the state wasn't tampered with by the zkApp developer using non-contract logic, for example, before deploying the zkApp
- New on-chain value `globalSlot`, to make assertions about the current time https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/649
  - example: `this.globalSlot.get()`, `this.globalSlot.assertBetween(lower, upper)`
  - Replaces `network.timestamp`, `network.globalSlotSinceGenesis` and `network.globalSlotSinceHardFork`. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/560
- New permissions:
  - `access` to control whether account updates for this account can be used at all https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/500
  - `setTiming` to control who can update the account's `timing` field https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/685
  - Example: `this.permissions.set({ ...Permissions.default(), access: Permissions.proofOrSignature() })`
- Expose low-level view into the PLONK gates created by a smart contract method https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/687
  - `MyContract.analyzeMethods().<method name>.gates`

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: Modify signature algorithm used by `Signature.{create,verify}` to be compatible with mina-signer https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/710
  - Signatures created with mina-signer's `client.signFields()` can now be verified inside a SNARK!
  - Breaks existing deployed smart contracts which use `Signature.verify()`
- BREAKING CHANGE: Circuits changed due to core protocol and cryptography changes; this breaks all deployed contracts.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Change structure of `Account` type which is returned by `Mina.getAccount()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/741
  - for example, `account.appState` -> `account.zkapp.appState`
  - full new type (exported as `Types.Account`): https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/blob/0be70cb8ceb423976f348980e9d6238820758cc0/src/provable/gen/transaction.ts#L515
- Test accounts hard-coded in `LocalBlockchain` now have default permissions, not permissions allowing everything. Fixes some unintuitive behaviour in tests, like requiring no signature when using these accounts to send MINA https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/638

### Removed

- Preconditions `timestamp` and `globalSlotSinceHardFork` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/560
  - `timestamp` is expected to come back as a wrapper for the new `globalSlot`

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/d880bd6e...c5a36207)

### Added

- `this.account.<field>.set()` as a unified API to update fields on the account https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/643
  - covers `permissions`, `verificationKey`, `zkappUri`, `tokenSymbol`, `delegate`, `votingFor`
  - exists on `SmartContract.account` and `AccountUpdate.account`
- `this.sender` to get the public key of the transaction's sender https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/652
  - To get the sender outside a smart contract, there's now `Mina.sender()`
- `tx.wait()` is now implemented. It waits for the transactions inclusion in a block https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/645
  - `wait()` also now takes an optional `options` parameter to specify the polling interval or maximum attempts. `wait(options?: { maxAttempts?: number; interval?: number }): Promise<void>;`
- `Circuit.constraintSystemFromKeypair(keypair)` to inspect the circuit at a low level https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/529
  - Works with a `keypair` (prover + verifier key) generated with the `Circuit` API
- `Mina.faucet()` can now be used to programmatically fund an address on the testnet, using the faucet provided by faucet.minaprotocol.com https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/693

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: Constraint changes in `sign()`, `requireSignature()` and `createSigned()` on `AccountUpdate` / `SmartContract`. _This means that smart contracts using these methods in their proofs won't be able to create valid proofs against old deployed verification keys._ https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/637
- `Mina.transaction` now takes a _public key_ as the fee payer argument (passing in a private key is deprecated) https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/652
  - Before: `Mina.transaction(privateKey, ...)`. Now: `Mina.transaction(publicKey, ...)`
  - `AccountUpdate.fundNewAccount()` now enables funding multiple accounts at once, and deprecates the `initialBalance` argument
- New option `enforceTransactionLimits` for `LocalBlockchain` (default value: `true`), to disable the enforcement of protocol transaction limits (maximum events, maximum sequence events and enforcing certain layout of `AccountUpdate`s depending on their authorization) https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/620
- Change the default `send` permissions (for sending MINA or tokens) that get set when deploying a zkApp, from `signature()` to `proof()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/648
- Functions for making assertions and comparisons have been renamed to their long form, instead of the initial abbreviation. Old function names have been deprecated https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/681
  - `.lt` -> `.lessThan`
  - `.lte` -> `.lessThanOrEqual`
  - `.gt` -> `.greaterThan`
  - `.gte` -> `greaterThanOrEqual`

### Deprecated

- `this.setPermissions()` in favor of `this.account.permissions.set()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/643
  - `this.tokenSymbol.set()` in favor of `this.account.tokenSymbol.set()`
  - `this.setValue()` in favor of `this.account.<field>.set()`

- Fix use of stale cached accounts in `Mina.transaction` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/430

## [0.7.3](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/5f20f496...d880bd6e)

### Fixed

- Bug in `deploy()` when initializing a contract that already exists https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/588

### Deprecated

- `Mina.BerkeleyQANet` in favor of the clearer-named `Mina.Network` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/588

### Added

- Added an optional string parameter to certain `assert` methods https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/470
- `Struct`, a new primitive for declaring composite, SNARK-compatible types https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/416
  - With this, we also added a way to include auxiliary, non-field element data in composite types
  - Added `VerificationKey`, which is a `Struct` with auxiliary data, to pass verification keys to a `@method`
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Change names related to circuit types: `AsFieldsAndAux<T>` -> `Provable<T>`, `AsFieldElement<T>` -> `ProvablePure<T>`, `circuitValue` -> `provable`
  - BREAKING CHANGE: Change all `ofFields` and `ofBits` methods on circuit types to `fromFields` and `fromBits`
- New option `proofsEnabled` for `LocalBlockchain` (default value: `true`), to quickly test transaction logic with proofs disabled https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/462
  - with `proofsEnabled: true`, proofs now get verified locally https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/423
- `SmartContract.approve()` to approve a tree of child account updates https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/428 https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/534
  - AccountUpdates are now valid `@method` arguments, and `approve()` is intended to be used on them when passed to a method

- `Circuit.log()` to easily log Fields and other provable types inside a method, with the same API as `console.log()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/484
- `SmartContract.init()` is a new method on the base `SmartContract` that will be called only during the first deploy (not if you re-deploy later to upgrade the contract) https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/543
  - Overriding `init()` is the new recommended way to add custom state initialization logic.
- `transaction.toPretty()` and `accountUpdate.toPretty()` for debugging transactions by printing only the pieces that differ from default account updates https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/428
- `AccountUpdate.attachToTransaction()` for explicitly adding an account update to the current transaction. This replaces some previous behaviour where an account update got attached implicitly https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/484
- `SmartContract.requireSignature()` and `AccountUpdate.requireSignature()` as a simpler, better-named replacement for `.sign()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/558

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: `tx.send()` is now asynchronous: old: `send(): TransactionId` new: `send(): Promise<TransactionId>` and `tx.send()` now directly waits for the network response, as opposed to `tx.send().wait()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/423
- Sending transactions to `LocalBlockchain` now involves
- `Circuit.witness` can now be called outside circuits, where it will just directly return the callback result https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/484
- The `FeePayerSpec`, which is used to specify properties of the transaction via `Mina.transaction()`, now has another optional parameter to specify the nonce manually. `Mina.transaction({ feePayerKey: feePayer, nonce: 1 }, () => {})` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/497
- BREAKING CHANGE: Static methods of type `.fromString()`, `.fromNumber()` and `.fromBigInt()` on `Field`, `UInt64`, `UInt32` and `Int64` are no longer supported https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/519

- Move several features out of 'experimental' https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/555
  - `Reducer` replaces `Experimental.Reducer`
  - `MerkleTree` and `MerkleWitness` replace `Experimental.{MerkleTree,MerkleWitness}`
  - In a `SmartContract`, `this.token` replaces `this.experimental.token`

### Deprecated

- `CircuitValue` deprecated in favor of `Struct` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/416

### Fixed

- Proof verification on the web version https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/476

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/f2ad423...ba688523)

### Added

- `reducer.getActions` partially implemented for local testing https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/327
- `gte` and `assertGte` methods on `UInt32`, `UInt64` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/349
- Return sent transaction `hash` for `RemoteBlockchain` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/399

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: Rename the `Party` class to `AccountUpdate`. Also, rename other occurrences of "party" to "account update". https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/393
- BREAKING CHANGE: Don't require the account address as input to `SmartContract.compile()`, `SmartContract.digest()` and `SmartContract.analyzeMethods()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/406
  - This works because the address / public key is now a variable in the method circuit; it used to be a constant
- BREAKING CHANGE: Move `ZkProgram` to `Experimental.ZkProgram`

## [0.5.4](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/3461333...f2ad423)

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/2375f08...e0192f7)

### Added

- **Recursive proofs**. RFC: https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/89, PRs: https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/245 https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/250 https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/261
  - Enable smart contract methods to take previous proofs as arguments, and verify them in the circuit
  - Add `ZkProgram`, a new primitive which represents a collection of circuits that produce instances of the same proof. So, it's a more general version of `SmartContract`, without any of the Mina-related API.  
    `ZkProgram` is suitable for rollup-type systems and offchain usage of Pickles + Kimchi.
- **zkApp composability** -- calling other zkApps from inside zkApps. RFC: https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/303, PRs: https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/285, https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/296, https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/294, https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/297

  - `fetchEvents` partially implemented for local testing: https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/323
- **Payments**: `this.send({ to, amount })` as an easier API for sending Mina from smart contracts https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/325
  - `Party.send()` to transfer Mina between any accounts, for example, from users to smart contracts
- `SmartContract.digest()` to quickly compute a hash of the contract's circuit. This is [used by the zkApp CLI](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/pull/233) to figure out whether `compile` should be re-run or a cached verification key can be used. https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/268
- `Circuit.constraintSystem()` for creating a circuit from a function, counting the number of constraints and computing a digest of the circuit https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/279
- `this.account.isNew` to assert that an account did not (or did) exist before the transaction https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11524
- `LocalBlockchain.setTimestamp` and other setters for network state, to test network preconditions locally https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/329
- **Experimental APIs** are now collected under the `Experimental` import, or on `this.experimental` in a smart contract.
- Custom tokens (_experimental_), via `this.token`. RFC: https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/233, PR: https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/273,
- Actions / sequence events support (_experimental_), via `Experimental.Reducer`. RFC: https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/265, PR: https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/274
- Merkle tree implementation (_experimental_) via `Experimental.MerkleTree` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/343

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: Make on-chain state consistent with other preconditions - throw an error when state is not explicitly constrained https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/267
- `CircuitValue` improvements https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/269, https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/306, https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/341
  - Added a base constructor, so overriding the constructor on classes that extend `CircuitValue` is now _optional_. When overriding, the base constructor can be called without arguments, as previously: `super()`. When not overriding, the expected arguments are all the `@prop`s on the class, in the order they were defined in: `new MyCircuitValue(prop1, prop2)`.
  - `CircuitValue.fromObject({ prop1, prop2 })` is a new, better-typed alternative for using the base constructor.
  - Fixed: the overridden constructor is now free to have any argument structure -- previously, arguments had to be the props in their declared order. I.e., the behaviour that's now used by the base constructor used to be forced on all constructors, which is no longer the case.
- `Mina.transaction` improvements
  - Support zkApp proofs when there are other account updates in the same transaction block https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/280
  - Support multiple independent zkApp proofs in one transaction block https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/296
- Add previously unimplemented preconditions, like `this.network.timestamp` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/324 https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11577
- Improve error messages thrown from Wasm, by making Rust's `panic` log to the JS console https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11644
- Not user-facing, but essential: Smart contracts fully constrain the account updates they create, inside the circuit https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/278

### Fixed

- Fix comparisons on `UInt32` and `UInt64` (`UInt32.lt`, `UInt32.gt`, etc) https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/174, https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/101. PR: https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/307

## [0.4.3](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/e66f08d...2375f08)

### Added

- Implement the [precondition RFC](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/179#issuecomment-1139413831):
  - new fields `this.account` and `this.network` on both `SmartContract` and `Party`
  - `this.<account|network>.<property>.get()` to use on-chain values in a circuit, e.g. account balance or block height
  - `this.<account|network>.<property>.{assertEqual, assertBetween, assertNothing}()` to constrain what values to allow for these
- `CircuitString`, a snark-compatible string type with methods like `.append()` https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/155
- `bool.assertTrue()`, `bool.assertFalse()` as convenient aliases for existing functionality
- `Ledger.verifyPartyProof` which can check if a proof on a transaction is valid https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/208
- Memo field in APIs like `Mina.transaction` to attach arbitrary messages https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/244
- This changelog

### Changed

- Huge snark performance improvements (2-10x) for most zkApps https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11053
- Performance improvements in node with > 4 CPUs, for all snarks https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11292
- Substantial reduction of o1js' size https://github.com/MinaProtocol/mina/pull/11166

### Removed

- Unused functions `call` and `callUnproved`, which were embryonic versions of what is now the `transaction` API to call smart contract methods
- Some unimplemented fields on `SmartContract`

### Fixed

- zkApp proving on web https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/226
