# Test Archive

This directory contains preserved test files from the floating test cleanup.

## Preserved Files

- **test-backend-routing.mjs**: Identifies critical globalThis.__snarky routing bug
- **debug-vk-generation.mjs**: Comprehensive VK analysis with detailed diagnostics
- **test-constraint-comparison.mjs**: Good template for constraint system analysis
- **test-sparky-basic.mjs**: Clean Sparky validation pattern

## Context

These files were preserved during the systematic cleanup of 60+ floating test files
that were replaced by the new consolidated test framework in `src/test/`.

The preserved files contain unique insights into the constraint routing bug and
backend switching infrastructure that are valuable for future debugging.
