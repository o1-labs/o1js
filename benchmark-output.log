📋 FRESH SNAPSHOT FIX: toJson processing 698 fresh constraints (snapshot had 0)
🔧 FULL PIPELINE: Starting MIR optimization + LIR lowering
✅ MIR conversion successful: 698 constraints
✅ MIR optimization completed
❌ MIR→LIR transformation failed: Transform("Unknown custom constraint: RangeCheck1")
🚨 Sparky Optimization Failure (LIR_TRANSFORMATION) Error: MIR→LIR transformation failed: Transform("Unknown custom constraint: RangeCheck1")
Optimization Stats: OptimizationStats { total_attempts: 128, mir_conversion_failures: 0, coordinator_failures: 0, successful_optimizations: 114 }
⚠️ FALLBACK: Using MIR-optimized constraints without LIR lowering
📊 FRESH SNAPSHOT FIX: rows() returning 567 constraints (fresh: 698, snapshot: 0)
📊 FRESH SNAPSHOT FIX: digest() using 571 optimized constraints (fresh: 698, snapshot: 0)
🔧 CONSTRAINT FIX: Calling endConstraintAccumulation() for Sparky backend
  ✅ Heavy Constraints: 3607.95ms (VK: 26594129..., Constraints: 567)
