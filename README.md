# SnarkyJS

To write a Snapp, we recommend using the [Snapp CLI](https://github.com/o1-labs/snapp-cli), which makes writing a Snapp easy by including SnarkyJS & providing project scaffolding, a test framework, and formatting.

SnarkyJS's documentation is available [here](https://o1-labs.github.io/snarkyjs/).
