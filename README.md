o1js helps developers build apps powered by zero-knowledge (zk) cryptography.

The easiest way to write zk programs is using o1js.  

o1js is a TypeScript library for [zk-SNARKs](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/what-are-zk-snarks) and zkApps. You can use o1js to write zk smart contracts based on zero-knowledge proofs for the Mina Protocol. 

o1js is automatically included when you create a project using the [Mina zkApp CLI](https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli). 

## Learn More

- To learn more about developing zkApps, see the [zkApp Developers](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps) docs.

- For guided steps building and using zkApps, see the [zkApp Developers Tutorials](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/tutorials/hello-world).

- To meet other developers building zkApps with o1js, participate in the [#zkapps-developers](https://discord.com/channels/484437221055922177/915745847692636181) channel on Mina Protocol Discord.
