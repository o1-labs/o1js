**Created:** January 7, 2025
**Last Modified:** January 7, 2025

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a comprehensive cleanup of the Sparky optimization pipeline to achieve:
- **10-100x performance improvement** through algorithmic fixes
- **50% memory reduction** through efficient data structures
- **Clean, modular architecture** with proper abstractions

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Issues
1. **O(nÂ²) to O(nÂ³) algorithms** causing massive slowdowns
2. **Redundant computations** and excessive cloning
3. **Poor architectural design** with rigid pass ordering
4. **Memory waste** from inefficient data structures
5. **Missing infrastructure** (cost models, dependency analysis)

## Phase 1: Performance Critical Fixes (Week 1)

### 1.1 Eliminate Remaining O(nÂ²) Algorithms âœ…
- [x] Fixed Vec::remove in loops (already completed)

- [ ] Implement persistent def-use chains

### 1.2 Create Efficient Constraint Removal Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement `ConstraintRemovalBatch` utility
- [ ] Use tombstone marking instead of immediate removal
- [ ] Batch all removals at end of optimization pipeline

### 1.3 Optimize Data Structures
- [ ] Replace BTreeMap with HashMap where ordering not required
- [ ] Use `&'static str` for optimization hint keys
- [ ] Implement copy-on-write for linear combinations

## Phase 2: Architectural Improvements (Week 2)

### 2.1 Flexible Pass Manager

- [ ] Track which constraints have been processed
- [ ] Implement worklist-based incremental updates

## Phase 3: Memory Efficiency (Week 3)

### 3.1 Eliminate Unnecessary Cloning
- [ ] Use references in analysis passes
- [ ] Implement in-place constraint mutation
- [ ] Add lifetime management for temporary data

### 3.2 Efficient Variable Management
- [ ] Implement variable renaming without full IR rebuild
- [ ] Use compact variable representation
- [ ] Add variable lifetime analysis

### 3.3 Constraint System Compaction
- [ ] Implement constraint deduplication

## Phase 4: Advanced Optimizations (Week 4)

### 4.1 Cost Model Implementation
- [ ] Add constraint evaluation cost metrics
- [ ] Implement optimization benefit analysis
- [ ] Create adaptive optimization strategies

### 4.2 SSA Form Implementation
- [ ] Convert MIR to proper SSA form
- [ ] Maintain use-def chains incrementally
- [ ] Add dominance tree construction

### 4.3 Parallel Optimization
- [ ] Identify independent optimization regions
- [ ] Implement parallel pass execution
- [ ] Add thread-safe constraint updates

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: Performance Critical
1. Fix all O(nÂ²) algorithms
2. Implement efficient removal infrastructure
3. Optimize hot-path data structures

### Week 2: Architecture
1. Design and implement PassManager
2. Unify pattern recognition
3. Build incremental infrastructure

### Week 3: Memory
1. Eliminate cloning in hot paths
2. Implement efficient variable management
3. Compact constraint representation

### Week 4: Advanced
1. Implement cost modeling
2. Add SSA form
3. Enable parallel optimization

## Success Metrics

### Performance
- **Constraint optimization time**: < 100ms for 10K constraints
- **Memory usage**: < 50MB for 10K constraints
- **Pass execution**: < 10ms per pass average

### Code Quality
- **Abstraction**: All passes implement common traits
- **Modularity**: Each optimization in separate module
- **Testing**: 90%+ code coverage

### Architectural
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic pass ordering
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new optimizations
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## Risk Mitigation

### Regression Prevention
- Add comprehensive benchmarks before changes
- Implement optimization validation tests
- Use property-based testing for correctness

### Incremental Rollout
- Feature flag new optimizations
- A/B test performance improvements
- Gradual migration from old to new

## Current Progress

### âœ… Completed
