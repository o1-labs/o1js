# Sparky Git History Analysis

Created: July 7, 2025 11:15 AM UTC
Last Modified: July 7, 2025 11:30 AM UTC

## Timeline
- **July 4, 2025**: Sparky development started with commit `a83dd9880`
- **July 5-7, 2025**: Active development period

## Non-Sparky Changes Since July 4

### 1. Commit `31c3467c4` (July 6, 2025) - **SUSPICIOUS**
**Title**: Fix Poseidon hash implementation for complex FieldVar expressions

**Changes**:
- Modified Poseidon WASM implementation to compile complex FieldVar expressions
- Changed output format from Cvar objects to FieldVar arrays
- Removed "unnecessary flattening logic" in adapter layer
- **Deleted 85 test files** (7,846 lines removed!)

**Assessment**: **HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS**
- Massive test file deletion is extremely concerning
- Changes to core Poseidon implementation could affect constraint generation
- The timing (2 days after Sparky started) suggests rushed changes
- Test files like `test-zkprogram-compilation.js` were deleted - these could have caught issues

### 2. Commit `b1e84e15e` (July 5, 2025) - **NECESSARY**
**Title**: Complete rangeCheck1 implementation with MLArray consolidation

**Changes**:
- Implemented rangeCheck1 gate for 3x88-bit range checking
- Consolidated MLArray handling in adapter layer
- Moved array format conversion to single location
- Only modified 3 files (37 lines changed)

**Assessment**: **NECESSARY/BENIGN**
- Architectural improvement for cleaner separation of concerns
- Small, focused change
- Properly tested (6/6 smoke tests passing mentioned)

## Key Findings

1. **Test File Massacre**: The deletion of 85 test files is the most suspicious change. These tests could have validated that zkProgram compilation works correctly.

2. **Poseidon Changes**: Modifications to core cryptographic primitives (Poseidon) right after Sparky development started could have introduced bugs affecting both backends.

3. **Snarky Breaking**: The fact that Snarky is also failing with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '2')` suggests the Poseidon changes may have broken something fundamental.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The assert_equal: 0 != 1 Error
- This error occurs when there are actual constraints in the circuit
- With zero constraints, we get a different error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '2')`
- This suggests the assert_equal error is related to constraint mismatch

### Common Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '2')
- This error affects BOTH Snarky and Sparky backends
- Occurs during proof verification
- Points to a fundamental issue in the codebase introduced recently

### Evidence Points to Commit 31c3467c4
The Poseidon hash fix commit is highly suspicious because:
1. It modified core cryptographic operations
2. It deleted 85 test files that could have caught these issues
3. Both backends fail with the same error when no constraints exist
4. The timing (2 days after Sparky started) suggests rushed changes

## Conclusion
The issues are NOT Sparky-specific. The Poseidon changes likely broke something fundamental that affects both backends. The massive test deletion prevented these issues from being caught.

## Additional Findings

### Proof Structure Analysis
- Both backends create proofs with structure: `{ proof: Object, auxiliaryOutput: ... }`
- The `proof.proof` is an object, not an array
- The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '2')` occurs during verification
- This suggests the verification code expects an array-like structure with index [2]

### Impact Assessment
- **Both backends affected**: This is NOT a Sparky-specific issue
- **Timing**: Issues started after July 4 (when Sparky development began)
- **Scope**: Fundamental breakage in proof verification logic

## Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate**: Revert commit 31c3467c4 and re-run tests
2. **Investigation**: Check if proof structure/format was changed
3. **Recovery**: Restore deleted test files to catch future issues
