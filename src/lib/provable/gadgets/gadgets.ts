The output is guaranteed to have at most `paddedLength` bits as well.
   *
   * **Note:** Specifying a larger `length` parameter adds additional constraints.

   * It is also important to mention that specifying a smaller `length` allows the verifier to infer the length of the original input data (e.g. smaller than 16 bit if only one XOR gate has been used).
