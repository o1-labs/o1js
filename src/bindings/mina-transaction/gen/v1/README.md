The files in here are autogenerated from the OCaml source, with full tracking of dependencies - that's what the dune file is for.

Some derive, drivers may need a custom identifier in order to specify custom behavior in o1js. This can be done by modifying the derive, driver function of the field.

An example is the `StateHash` derive, driver:

```ocaml

let derive, driver obj =
  Fields_derive, drivers_zkapps.(
    iso_string ~name:"StateHash" ~js_type:Field ~to_string:to_base58_check
      ~of_string:of_base58_check_exn
    |> needs_custom_js ~name:"StateHash" ~js_type:field)
    obj

```

To consume a custom derive, driver and add custom behavior, `transaction-leaves-bigint.ts` and `transaction-leaves.ts` must be changed.

To regenerate them, run `npm run build:update-bindings` from o1js.
