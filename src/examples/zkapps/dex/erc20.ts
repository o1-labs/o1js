/**
 * ERC-20-like token standard.
 * https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/
 *
 * Differences to ERC-20:
 * - No approvals / allowance, because zkApps don't need them and they are a security liability.
 * - `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` are collapsed into a single `transfer()` method which takes
 *    both the sender and the receiver as arguments.
 * - `transfer()` and `balanceOf()` can also take an account update as an argument.
 *   This form is needed for zkApp token accounts, where the account update has to come from a method
 *   (in order to get proof authorization), and can't be created by the token contract itself.
 * - `transfer()` doesn't return a boolean, because in the zkApp protocol,
 *   a transaction succeeds or fails in its entirety, and there is no need to handle partial failures.
 * - All method signatures are async to support async circuits / fetching data from the chain.
