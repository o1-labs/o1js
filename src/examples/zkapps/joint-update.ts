/**
 * This is an example for two zkapps that are guaranteed to update their states _together_.
 *
 * So, A's state will updated if and only if B's state is updated, and vice versa.
 *
 * The difficulty here is that, while zkApps know and prove which other zkApps they call themselves,
 * there's nothing in the protocol that lets them know which other zkApps are calling _them_.
 *
 * In other words, while one-way interactions are easy to implement, two-way interactions require additional tricks.
 *
 * This example is supposed to give you an idea for how to implement two-way interactions.
 *
 * The idea is that the user calls B, which calls A, so B knows it's jointly updating with A.
 * In addition, B sets a flag "insideBUpdate" to true on its onchain state, which A checks to make sure it's being called from B.
 * This flag is also reset by the method that A calls, so it's guaranteed to always be false when we're not inside a B update.
 * That way, both A and B can be sure that they're updating together.
 *
 * To understand the flow of this example in detail, keep in mind that zkApp updates are applied top-to-bottom:
 * 1. First, the account update created by `B.updateWithA()` is applied. It sets `insideBUpdate = true`.
 * 2. Then, `A.updateWithB()` is applied.
 * 3. Finally, `B.assertInsideUpdate()` is applied. It checks that `insideBUpdate = true` and sets it back to false.
