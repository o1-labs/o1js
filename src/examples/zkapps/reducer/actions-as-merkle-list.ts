/**
 * This example shows how to iterate through incoming actions, not using `Reducer.reduce` but by
 * treating the actions as a merkle list.
 *
 * This is mainly intended as an example for using `MerkleList`, but it might also be useful as
 * a blueprint for processing actions in a custom and more explicit way.
 *
 * Warning: The reducer API in o1js is currently not safe to use in production applications. The `reduce()`
 * method breaks if more than the hard-coded number (default: 32) of actions are pending. Work is actively
 * in progress to mitigate this limitation.
