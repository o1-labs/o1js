# Crypto examples

These examples show how to use some of the crypto primitives that are supported in provable o1js code.

- Non-native field arithmetic: `foreign-field.ts`
- Non-native ECDSA verification: `ecdsa.ts`

As a more low-level example, you will also find an RSA implementation using a custom bigint type implemented using efficient o1js range checks:

- RSA signature verification: `rsa/`
