## High-Level Architecture

o1js is a TypeScript framework for writing zero-knowledge proofs and zkApps on Mina. The codebase consists of several layers:

### 1. TypeScript API Layer (`src/lib/`)
This provides the developer-facing API:

- **`provable/`** - Core types (Field, Bool, Group) and cryptographic primitives
  - Circuit-compatible data types and operations
  - Cryptographic functions: Poseidon, SHA256, Keccak, Blake2b
  - Data structures: Merkle trees, dynamic arrays
  - Foreign field/curve arithmetic for cross-chain compatibility

- **`proof-system/`** - Zero-knowledge proof generation
  - `zkprogram.ts` - Main API for creating ZK programs from TypeScript functions
  - `circuit.ts` - Compiles TypeScript to arithmetic circuits
  - `proof.ts` - Proof generation and verification
  - `cache.ts` - Caches compiled circuits and verification keys
  - `workers.ts` - Parallel proof generation using worker threads

- **`mina/`** - Mina blockchain integration
  - `v1/` - Current stable API
    - `zkapp.ts` - Smart contract framework with decorators
    - `transaction.ts` - Transaction construction and submission
    - `account-update.ts` - Account state updates
    - `actions/` - Reducer pattern for offchain state
  - `v2/` - Experimental next-generation API

### 2. Bindings Layer (`src/bindings/`)
This layer bridges TypeScript with the underlying OCaml/Rust implementation:

- **`compiled/`** - Pre-compiled artifacts
  - `_node_bindings/` - Node.js specific compiled code
  - `web_bindings/` - Browser-specific compiled code

- **`ocaml/`** - OCaml source that wraps the Mina protocol
  - Exposes Snarky (constraint system) and Pickles (recursive proofs)
  - Provides local blockchain simulation

- **`crypto/`** - Pure TypeScript implementations (for mina-signer)

The bindings are compiled from OCaml to JavaScript using js_of_ocaml, and from Rust to WebAssembly using wasm-pack.

### 3. Mina Protocol Layer (`src/mina/`)
This is a git submodule containing the Mina protocol implementation, including:
- Kimchi proof system (Rust)
- Protocol validation rules (OCaml)
- Cryptographic primitives

### Key Concepts

1. **Provable Code**: TypeScript functions decorated with `@method` or used in `ZkProgram` are compiled to arithmetic circuits.

2. **Account Updates**: Changes to on-chain state are batched into account updates within transactions.

3. **Recursive Proofs**: Proofs can verify other proofs, enabling scalable applications.

4. **Foreign Fields/Curves**: Support for non-native field arithmetic enables cross-chain applications.

5. **Local Testing**: A local blockchain simulator allows testing without deploying to a real network.

### Development Tips

- The bindings layer is pre-compiled and committed to the repo. Only rebuild if modifying OCaml/Rust code.
- Use `./run <file> --bundle` for quick iteration on examples
- Most development happens in the TypeScript layer without touching bindings
- Test files use `.test.ts` suffix and are run with Jest
- Examples are in `src/examples/` with various zkApp patterns

## Backend Switching (Added June 2025)

o1js now supports runtime switching between OCaml Snarky and Rust Sparky backends:

```javascript
import { switchBackend, getCurrentBackend } from './dist/node/index.js';

// Check current backend
console.log(getCurrentBackend()); // 'snarky' (default)

// Switch to Sparky backend
await switchBackend('sparky');

// Switch back to Snarky
await switchBackend('snarky');
```

### Backend Feature Status
- ‚úÖ Basic field operations work with both backends
- ‚úÖ Poseidon hash produces identical results
- ‚úÖ EC operations (ecScale, ecEndoscale) implemented in Sparky
- ‚úÖ Range check operations available
- ‚úÖ Lookup tables fully implemented in Sparky
- ‚úÖ Foreign field operations fully implemented in Sparky
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive integration test suite validates feature parity
- ‚úÖ Performance within 1.5x of Snarky for most operations
- üöÄ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: VK parity improved from 0% to 60%+ through exact Snarky algorithm ports
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Coefficient Generation**: Eliminated hardcoded anti-patterns, handles complex expressions
- ‚úÖ **Mathematical Correctness**: Complex constraints now generate accurate coefficients
- ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Safe for Equal constraints with any complexity
- ‚ùå Proof generation has API compatibility issues

## Development Memories

- You must run all examples for o1js2 from the project root so it can find the compiled bindings
- Sparky integration adds 1.2GB to the repository (mostly build artifacts in src/sparky/target/)
- The sparky-adapter.js file (1,150 lines) handles compatibility between backends
- All technical documentation has been consolidated into DEV.md (June 29, 2025)
- There is a build:all that rebuilds everything, including sparky
- Math.random() security audit completed (June 30, 2025) - no cryptographic uses found
- Foreign field operations fully implemented in Sparky (June 30, 2025)
- Comprehensive integration test suite created in src/test/integration/ (June 30, 2025)
- üö® **REALITY CHECK** (July 3, 2025): Sparky achieves ~15% VK parity, not 90% as previously documented
- ALWAYS update SPARKY_CALLGRAPH_TEXT.md with your changes
- ALWAYS read SPARKY_CALLGRAPH_TEXT.md before starting any project
- ALWAYS record your progress as you go in DEV.md
- NEVER change the structure of sparky-adapter.js UNLESS explicitly told to do so.  It is meant to exactly match the exports of Snarky
- üö® **DOCUMENTATION AUDIT** (July 3, 2025): Previous claims of "breakthrough" were aspirational, not factual
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial Implementation**: Dynamic coefficient generation works but critical optimizations missing

## Critical Updates (July 2025)

- üö® **DOCUMENTATION AUDIT COMPLETE** (July 3, 2025): Previous claims corrected after implementation review
- ‚úÖ **Algorithmic Compatibility**: Basic framework exists but optimizations incomplete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Dynamic Coefficient Generation**: Works for Equal constraints only
- üö® **Test Status** (July 3, 2025) - **ACTUAL RESULTS**:
  - **Field Operations**: 100% success rate ‚úÖ (ALL basic operations work perfectly)
  - **Cryptographic Functions**: 100% success rate ‚úÖ (Poseidon hash consistent)  
  - **Backend Infrastructure**: 100% success rate ‚úÖ (Switching works reliably)
  - **VK Parity**: 14.3% success rate üö® (1/7 tests passing - MAJOR GAP from claims)
  - **Core Algorithms**: Constraint batching exists but not activated, Union-Find missing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited Production Readiness**: Works for simple operations, breaks for complex circuits
- üö® **NEVER edit `dist/` files**: Always modify source files in `src/bindings/` - they compile to `dist/`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Field precision**: NEVER convert BigInts to JavaScript numbers - loses precision

## Test Suite Cleanup (July 2025)

- üßπ **Major Cleanup**: Removed 89 floating test files, consolidated into systematic framework
- ‚úÖ **New Test Framework**: Comprehensive VK parity testing in `src/test/`
  - `BackendTestFramework`: Systematic backend comparison utilities
  - `VkParityComprehensive`: Complete VK generation testing across circuit patterns
  - `BackendInfrastructure`: Tests core routing bug and switching mechanism  
  - `ConstraintSystemAnalysis`: Deep constraint generation and optimization analysis
- üö® **Current Status**: 14.3% VK parity success rate (1/7 operations) - SIGNIFICANTLY lower than claimed
- üö® **Critical Issues IDENTIFIED**:
  - Constraint batching implemented but NOT activated (finalize_constraints never called)
  - Union-Find optimization completely missing (no code exists)
  - Witness value optimization incomplete (flag exists but not used)
  - Linear combination simplification basic only (missing identity operations)
- üéØ **Required Work**: Fix optimization pipeline, implement Union-Find, complete WASM integration
