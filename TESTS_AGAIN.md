# SPARKY PARALLEL TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE IMPLEMENTATION

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Redesign scattered sparky vs snarky testing infrastructure with backend-isolated parallel execution to achieve 5x speedup (60min → 12min) while maintaining full test coverage.

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Backend-Isolated Process Design
```
Process 1: Snarky Backend (smoke + field-ops)     - ~600MB, 3min
Process 2: Snarky Backend (vk-parity + complex)   - ~600MB, 8min  
Process 3: Sparky Backend (smoke + field-ops)     - ~600MB, 3min
Process 4: Sparky Backend (vk-parity + complex)   - ~600MB, 8min
Process 5: Integration (backend switching tests)   - ~600MB, 2min
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
SPARKY_TEST_PROCESSES=4        # Default: 4, CI can override to 2
SPARKY_TEST_MODE=parallel      # parallel|sequential (for debugging)
SPARKY_TEST_AGGRESSIVE_MEMORY=true  # 600MB limit per process
```

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### ✅ PHASE 1: PLANNING & SETUP
- [x] Create detailed implementation plan (TESTS_AGAIN.md)
- [x] Update todo tracking system
- [x] Analyze existing scattered test files

#### Analysis Results
- **36 test files found** - ALL related to sparky vs snarky testing
- **~70% duplication** across files with overlapping functionality
- **Good patterns identified**: `runWithBothBackends()`, `expectEqualResults()`
- **Anti-patterns found**: Backend state leakage, mixed concerns
- **Migration target**: Consolidate to ~10 focused test files in new architecture

### ✅ PHASE 2: CORE INFRASTRUCTURE
- [x] Create directory structure (src/test/sparky/)
- [x] Build ParallelTestRunner orchestrator
- [x] Build BackendIsolatedWorker

  - [x] `test:sparky-debug` (sequential mode for debugging)
- [x] Create CLI interface with environment variable support
- [x] Add sequential execution mode for debugging
- [x] Create tier-based commands (smoke, core, comprehensive)

### ✅ PHASE 5: AUTOMATIC TEST DISCOVERY
- [x] Implement TestDiscovery class with filesystem scanning
- [x] Automatic tier inference from suite naming (smoke/core/comprehensive)

- `smoke.suite.ts`: Basic field ops, quick health check
- `field-ops.suite.ts`: Mathematical correctness verification  
- `vk-parity.suite.ts`: VK generation for snarky circuits
- `complex.suite.ts`: Advanced circuit patterns in snarky

#### Sparky-Only Suites
