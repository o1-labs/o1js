# Test Framework Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the test framework to expect optimized constraint counts after re-enabling the `reduce_lincom` optimization in Sparky. This brings Sparky to parity with Snarky's optimized constraint generation.

## Key Changes

### 1. Constraint Count Expectations
- **Before**: Tests expected Sparky to generate more constraints than Snarky (e.g., 5 vs 3)
- **After**: Tests now expect both backends to generate the same optimized constraint count
- **Reason**: The `reduce_lincom` optimization has been re-enabled in Sparky

### 2. Test Files Updated

#### `src/test/constraint-system-analysis.test.ts`
- Updated all constraint count comparisons to expect matching counts
- Added expectations that both backends use the same optimization
- Updated header documentation to reflect the fixed state
- Changed expectations from `not.toBe()` to `toBe()` for constraint counts

#### `src/test/vk-parity-comprehensive.test.ts`
- Changed VK parity test expectations from failing to passing
- Updated constraint count match expectations to `true`
- Updated infrastructure validation to expect correct routing
- Changed console messages to reflect the fixed state

#### `src/test/backend-infrastructure.test.ts`
- Updated routing bug expectations to expect correct behavior
- Changed globalThis.__snarky update expectations to pass
- Updated constraint count match expectations to `true`

#### `src/test/integration/sparky-constraint-count.test.ts`
- Fixed the `countConstraints` helper function to use actual constraint system API
- Removed mock implementation that always returned 1

## Historical Context

### The reduce_lincom Optimization
- **What it does**: Optimizes linear combinations of field elements to reduce constraint count
- **Example**: Operations like `x + 2*x + 3*x` are optimized to `6*x` using fewer constraints
- **Impact**: Reduces constraint count from 5 to 3 for certain operations

### Why This Matters
1. **Performance**: Fewer constraints mean faster proof generation
2. **Compatibility**: Matching constraint counts ensure VK parity between backends
3. **Correctness**: Both backends should produce identical optimized circuits

## Testing the Changes

To verify the updates work correctly:

```bash
# Run constraint system analysis tests
npm run test:constraint-analysis

# Run VK parity tests
npm run test:vk-parity

# Run backend infrastructure tests
npm run test:backend-infrastructure

# Run the full test framework
npm run test:framework
```

## Expected Outcomes

With the `reduce_lincom` optimization re-enabled:

1. ✅ Constraint counts match between Snarky and Sparky
2. ✅ VK generation produces identical results
3. ✅ Backend routing works correctly
4. ✅ All optimization tests pass

## Notes for Developers

- If tests fail after these updates, it likely means the optimization hasn't been properly re-enabled
- Check that Sparky's constraint generation includes the `reduce_lincom` optimization
- Verify that globalThis.__snarky is properly updated when switching backends
