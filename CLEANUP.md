# Sparky Codebase Cleanup & Refactoring Plan
**Updated: July 2, 2025**

**Target**: Transform the fractured Sparky codebase into a clean, maintainable architecture that eliminates duplication and resolves the split-brain problems.

## Executive Summary - Updated Assessment

⚠️ **CRITICAL UPDATE**: Recent reaudit shows **mixed progress with core architectural problems persisting or worsening**.

### Progress Made Since Original Plan:
- ✅ **Warning reduction**: From 100+ to 29 warnings (71% improvement)
- ✅ **TODO cleanup**: From 37 to 15 active items (59% reduction)  
- ✅ **Documentation consolidation**: 20+ files merged into unified docs
- ✅ **Build configuration improvements**: Added cargo config for cleaner builds
- ✅ **WASM backup cleanup**: Removed 895 lines of obsolete backup implementations (July 2, 2025)

### Critical Issues That Remain/Worsened:
- 🚨 **Constraint system fragmentation**: **+57% code increase** (1,051 → 1,628 lines) across 3 implementations
- 🚨 **Field implementation duplication**: **UNCHANGED** - still 632+ lines of duplicate code
- 🚨 **TLS split-brain architecture**: **ZERO PROGRESS** - RefCell double-wrapping persists
- ✅ **WASM backup implementations**: **REMOVED** - 895 lines of obsolete backup code deleted (July 2, 2025)
- 🚨 **New issue**: `constraint_optimized.rs` (305 lines) **disabled due to compilation errors**

The original diagnosis remains **100% accurate** and **more urgent** than before. **Architectural debt is accumulating faster than it's being resolved**.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Incremental Development Anti-Pattern**
- Features added in isolation without refactoring existing code
- Multiple attempts at the same functionality retained instead of replaced
- Backup systems kept indefinitely, creating confusion

### 2. **Cross-Language Integration Complexity**
- Rust ↔ WASM ↔ JavaScript impedance mismatch
- Different error handling models across boundaries
- Multiple serialization/conversion layers

### 3. **OCaml Snarky Compatibility Pressure**
- Attempting to match OCaml interface exactly led to architectural compromises
- Multiple implementations created to achieve "compatibility"
- Performance optimization attempts created more complexity instead of replacing originals

## Detailed Problem Inventory

### A. Field Implementation Fracturing - **STATUS: UNCHANGED/WORSE**

**Current State (July 2025)**: Three separate field implementations with 90% duplicate code **+ additional growth**

**Files Affected**:
- `sparky-core/src/pallas_field.rs` (334 lines - **+70 lines since original audit**)
- `sparky-core/src/vesta_field.rs` (210+ lines - **similar growth pattern**)
- `sparky-core/src/field.rs` (88 lines - generic wrapper)
- **Total**: 632+ lines of duplicated field operations

**Assessment**: Instead of consolidation, **more duplicate code has been added**. The problem has grown worse rather than being addressed.

**Duplication Examples**:
```rust
// In pallas_field.rs
impl FieldElement {
    pub fn from_u64(val: u64) -> Self { /* ... */ }
    pub fn from_biguint(val: BigUint) -> Self { /* ... */ }
    pub fn to_biguint(&self) -> BigUint { /* ... */ }
}

// In vesta_field.rs  
impl FieldElement {
    pub fn from_u64(val: u64) -> Self { /* ... */ } // IDENTICAL
    pub fn from_biguint(val: BigUint) -> Self { /* ... */ } // IDENTICAL
    pub fn to_biguint(&self) -> BigUint { /* ... */ } // IDENTICAL
}
```

### B. Constraint System Split-Brain Architecture - **STATUS: SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE**

**Current State (July 2025)**: Three different constraint system implementations with **massive code growth**

**Critical Update - Code Explosion**:
1. **constraint.rs**: 1,047 lines (**+215 lines** - now implements optimization logic)
2. **constraint_optimizer.rs**: 276 lines (**+131 lines** - expanded optimization attempts)  
3. **constraint_optimized.rs**: 305 lines (**+231 lines** - **DISABLED in lib.rs due to compilation errors**)

**Total**: 1,628 lines (**+577 lines increase** = **+57% code growth**)

1. **Three Different Cvar Representations** (UNCHANGED):
   ```rust
   // constraint.rs (1,047 lines) - Main implementation with optimization
   enum Cvar { Constant, Var, Add, Scale }
   
   // constraint_optimizer.rs (276 lines) - Separate optimization logic
   struct LinearCombination { terms: HashMap<VarId, FieldElement> }
   
   // constraint_optimized.rs (305 lines) - DISABLED/BROKEN
   // pub mod constraint_optimized; // Temporarily disabled due to compilation errors
   ```

**New Critical Issue**: The third constraint implementation is **completely broken** and disabled, indicating **failed architectural experiments are accumulating as technical debt**.

2. **Overlapping Functionality**:
   - Constraint deduplication implemented in multiple places
   - Linear combination reduction with different algorithms
   - No clear ownership of constraint optimization

3. **Split-Brain Thread-Local Storage**:
   ```rust
   // run_state.rs
   pub struct RunState {
       constraint_system: RefCell<ConstraintSystem>, // First brain
   }
   
   // run_state_cell.rs
   thread_local! {
       static CURRENT_STATE: RefCell<RunState> = // Second brain
   }
   ```

### C. Lookup Table Duplication - **STATUS: UNCHANGED**

**Current State (July 2025)**: Complete duplication between core and gates with slight growth

**Files**:
- `sparky-core/src/lookup.rs` (425 lines - **unchanged**)
- `sparky-gates/src/lookup.rs` (252 lines - **+52 lines growth**)
- **Total**: 677 lines of duplicated lookup functionality

**Identical Structures** (still present):
```rust
// Both files still define the same structs
struct LookupConstraint { /* identical fields */ }
struct FixedLookupTable { /* identical fields */ }
struct RuntimeTable { /* identical fields */ }
```

**Assessment**: Problem persists with minor growth. **No progress** toward consolidation.

### D. WASM Layer Architectural Debt - **STATUS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT**

**Current State (July 2025)**: **MAJOR CLEANUP COMPLETED** - Backup implementations successfully removed

**Progress Made**:
- ✅ **`sparky-wasm/src/backup/` completely deleted** - Removed 895 lines of obsolete backup code
  - `backup/bindings.rs` (563 lines) - **DELETED**
  - `backup/conversion.rs` (234 lines) - **DELETED** 
  - `backup/lib.rs` (98 lines) - **DELETED**
- ✅ **Build verification passed** - No compilation errors after backup removal
- ✅ **Git cleanup verified** - Backup files were untracked, safe deletion confirmed

**Remaining Issues**:
- Field operations **still implemented** in both `field.rs` and `bindings.rs`
- Two separate conversion strategies **still need consolidation**

**Assessment**: **Significant progress** - Main backup implementations removed, indicating current implementations are stable. Further consolidation of remaining dual implementations still needed.

### E. **NEW CRITICAL ISSUE**: Disabled Constraint Module

**Discovered in July 2025 Reaudit**: 
```rust
// sparky-core/src/lib.rs
// pub mod constraint_optimized; // Temporarily disabled due to compilation errors
```

**Impact**:
- 305 lines of **broken optimization code** accumulating as technical debt
- **Failed architectural experiment** left in codebase instead of being cleaned up
- Indicates **lack of proper testing/CI** - broken code was committed
- **Split-brain problem getting worse** - now have a third (broken) constraint implementation

**Urgency**: **CRITICAL** - Broken code in the main codebase indicates development process issues

### F. Thread-Local Storage Split-Brain - **STATUS: COMPLETELY UNADDRESSED**

**Current State (July 2025)**: **Identical to original audit** - zero progress

```rust
// run_state_cell.rs - STILL using thread_local!
thread_local! {
    static CURRENT_STATE: RefCell<RunState> = RefCell::new(RunState::new(RunMode::ConstraintGeneration));
}

// run_state.rs - STILL using RefCell double-wrapping
pub struct RunState {
    constraint_system: RefCell<ConstraintSystem>, // DOUBLE WRAPPING PERSISTS!
    next_var_id: RefCell<usize>,
    witness: RefCell<HashMap<VarId, FieldElement>>,
}
```

**Assessment**: The **most critical architectural issue remains completely unaddressed**. This is the root cause of synchronization problems and WASM instability.

## Updated Risk Assessment

### 🔴 **CRITICAL RISK - Architecture Degrading**
1. **+57% constraint system code growth** without architectural improvement = **regression**
2. **Disabled broken modules** show failed experiments accumulating as debt
3. **TLS split-brain completely ignored** after 6+ months of development
4. **Field duplication growing** instead of being consolidated

### 🟡 **MEDIUM RISK - Superficial Progress**
1. **Warning reduction** may mask deeper problems rather than solving them
2. **TODO reduction** could represent deleted comments vs. completed work
3. **Documentation consolidation** helps maintenance but doesn't address core issues

## UPDATED Comprehensive Cleanup Plan

**CRITICAL**: Original plan remains valid but **urgency has increased**. Core problems are **unchanged or worse**.

## Phase 0: Emergency Cleanup (NEW - Week 0)

### 0.1 Remove Broken/Disabled Code
**Target**: Clean up failed experiments before they accumulate further

1. **Investigate `constraint_optimized.rs`**:
   - Either fix compilation errors immediately
   - OR delete the entire module if it's a failed experiment
   - Document decision and rationale

2. **Audit TODO deletion validity**:
   - Verify 22 removed TODOs represent completed work
   - If TODOs were deleted without implementation, restore them
   - Document current implementation status

3. **WASM backup assessment**:
   - Determine if backup implementations are still needed
   - If main implementations are stable, delete backups
   - If backups are still needed, this indicates main implementations are unstable

## Phase 1: Unify Field Implementations (Week 1) - **UNCHANGED PLAN**

### 1.1 Create Generic Field Trait System

**Target**: Single field implementation supporting both Pallas and Vesta

```rust
// New: sparky-core/src/field/mod.rs
pub trait PrimeField: 
    Add<Output = Self> + Sub<Output = Self> + Mul<Output = Self> + 
    Clone + Debug + PartialEq + Eq + Serialize + DeserializeOwned
{
    const MODULUS: &'static str;
    fn zero() -> Self;
    fn one() -> Self;
    fn from_u64(val: u64) -> Self;
    fn from_biguint(val: BigUint) -> Self;
    fn to_biguint(&self) -> BigUint;
    fn to_hex_string(&self) -> String;
    fn is_zero(&self) -> bool;
    fn square(&self) -> Self;
    fn neg(&self) -> Self;
    fn inv(&self) -> Option<Self>;
}

// Field-specific implementations
pub type PallasField = ArkField<ark_pallas::Fr>;
pub type VestaField = ArkField<ark_vesta::Fr>;

// Generic wrapper
pub struct ArkField<F: ark_ff::PrimeField>(F);
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create `sparky-core/src/field/mod.rs` with trait definition
2. Create `sparky-core/src/field/arkworks.rs` with generic ArkField implementation
3. Create `sparky-core/src/field/pallas.rs` with type alias and field-specific constants
4. Create `sparky-core/src/field/vesta.rs` with type alias and field-specific constants
5. Update all imports to use the new field module
6. **Delete** `pallas_field.rs` and `vesta_field.rs` entirely

**Expected Impact**: 
- Remove ~400 lines of duplicate code
- Single source of truth for field operations
- Easier to add new field types in future

### 1.2 Standardize Field Element Usage

**Target**: Single `FieldElement` type throughout codebase

```rust
// Current fragmented usage
use crate::pallas_field::FieldElement as PallasElement;
use crate::vesta_field::FieldElement as VestaElement;

// New unified usage  
use crate::field::{FieldElement, PallasField, VestaField};
type FieldElement = PallasField; // Default to Pallas for o1js compatibility
```

**Migration Script**:
```bash
# Replace all field imports
find . -name "*.rs" -exec sed -i 's/pallas_field::FieldElement/field::FieldElement/g' {} \;
find . -name "*.rs" -exec sed -i 's/vesta_field::FieldElement/field::FieldElement/g' {} \;
```

## Phase 2: Resolve TLS Split-Brain (Week 1-2)

### 2.1 Choose Single Run State Management

**Decision**: Eliminate thread-local storage entirely, use explicit state passing

**Rationale**:
- Thread-local storage creates hidden dependencies
- Makes testing and debugging difficult
- Causes synchronization issues in WASM single-threaded environment
- Explicit state passing is more functional and safer

**Target Architecture**:
```rust
// New: sparky-core/src/state.rs
pub struct SparkyState {
    pub constraint_system: ConstraintSystem,
    pub witness: HashMap<VarId, FieldElement>,
    pub next_var_id: usize,
    pub lookup_tables: LookupTableManager,
}

impl SparkyState {
    pub fn new() -> Self { /* ... */ }
    
    // All operations take &mut self explicitly
    pub fn add_constraint(&mut self, constraint: Constraint) { /* ... */ }
    pub fn create_var(&mut self, value: FieldElement) -> VarId { /* ... */ }
    pub fn get_constraint_system(&self) -> &ConstraintSystem { /* ... */ }
}
```

**Migration Steps**:
1. Create new `SparkyState` struct with all state centralized
2. Update all constraint system operations to take `&mut SparkyState`
3. Update WASM bindings to maintain state explicitly
4. **Delete** `run_state_cell.rs` entirely
5. **Delete** thread-local macros and usage
6. Update all function signatures to pass state explicitly

**WASM Integration**:
```rust
// sparky-wasm/src/state.rs
static mut GLOBAL_STATE: Option<SparkyState> = None;

pub fn initialize_state() {
    unsafe { GLOBAL_STATE = Some(SparkyState::new()); }
}

pub fn with_state<T>(f: impl FnOnce(&mut SparkyState) -> T) -> T {
    unsafe { 
        GLOBAL_STATE.as_mut()
            .expect("State not initialized")
            .pipe(f)
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Eliminate RefCell Double-Wrapping

**Current Problem**:
```rust
// Double RefCell wrapping creates deadlock potential
thread_local! {
    static STATE: RefCell<RunState> = RefCell::new(RunState {
        constraint_system: RefCell<ConstraintSystem>, // DOUBLE WRAPPING!
    });
}
```

**Solution**: Single ownership with explicit borrowing
```rust
pub struct SparkyState {
    constraint_system: ConstraintSystem, // No RefCell needed
    witness: HashMap<VarId, FieldElement>, // No RefCell needed
}

// Explicit mutable access when needed
impl SparkyState {
    pub fn constraint_system_mut(&mut self) -> &mut ConstraintSystem {
        &mut self.constraint_system
    }
}
```

## Phase 3: Consolidate Constraint Systems (Week 2)

### 3.1 Merge Constraint Modules

**Target**: Single constraint system implementation

**Current Fragmentation**:
- `constraint.rs` (832 lines) - Main implementation
- `constraint_optimizer.rs` (145 lines) - Optimization logic
- `constraint_optimized.rs` (74 lines) - Alternative implementation

**Consolidation Plan**:

1. **Keep**: `constraint.rs` as the main implementation
2. **Merge**: `constraint_optimizer.rs` functionality into `constraint.rs`
3. **Delete**: `constraint_optimized.rs` entirely

**New Unified Structure**:
```rust
// sparky-core/src/constraint.rs (consolidated)
pub mod cvar;           // Cvar definition and operations
pub mod constraint;     // Constraint types  
pub mod system;         // ConstraintSystem with optimization
pub mod optimizer;      // Linear combination optimization (merged from constraint_optimizer.rs)
pub mod conversion;     // Conversion to Kimchi format
```

### 3.2 Standardize Cvar Interface

**Current Problem**: Different Cvar representations
```rust
// constraint.rs
enum Cvar { Constant, Var, Add, Scale }

// constraint_optimizer.rs  
struct LinearCombination { terms: HashMap<VarId, FieldElement> }
```

**Solution**: Single Cvar with integrated optimization
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum Cvar {
    Constant(FieldElement),
    Var(VarId),
    LinearCombination(LinearCombination), // Integrated optimization
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct LinearCombination {
    constant: FieldElement,
    terms: HashMap<VarId, FieldElement>,
}

impl LinearCombination {
    pub fn reduce_lincom(self) -> (FieldElement, Vec<(FieldElement, VarId)>) {
        // Merge from constraint_optimizer.rs
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Linear Combination Optimization (EXCLUDED)

**Note**: The `reduce_lincom` optimization is excluded from this cleanup work as requested. This critical optimization for VK parity will be addressed separately.

The constraint system consolidation will prepare the infrastructure for `reduce_lincom` implementation, but the actual optimization logic will not be included in this cleanup phase.

## Phase 4: Cleanup Lookup Tables (Week 2-3)

### 4.1 Consolidate Lookup Implementations

**Target**: Single lookup implementation in sparky-core

**Current Duplication**:
- `sparky-core/src/lookup.rs` (425 lines) - Core structures
- `sparky-gates/src/lookup.rs` (200+ lines) - Gate integration

**Consolidation Strategy**:

1. **Keep**: `sparky-core/src/lookup.rs` as authoritative implementation
2. **Refactor**: `sparky-gates/src/lookup.rs` to use core implementation
3. **Create**: Clear interface between core and gates

**New Architecture**:
```rust
// sparky-core/src/lookup/mod.rs
pub mod constraint;     // LookupConstraint definition
pub mod table;         // Table management
pub mod manager;       // LookupTableManager

// sparky-gates/src/lookup.rs (simplified)
use sparky_core::lookup::{LookupConstraint, LookupTableManager};

pub fn create_xor_lookup_gate(/* ... */) -> LookupConstraint {
    // Use core structures, no duplication
}
```

### 4.2 Eliminate Struct Duplication

**Current Problem**: Identical structs in both files
```rust
// Both files define identical structures
struct LookupConstraint { /* same fields */ }
struct FixedLookupTable { /* same fields */ }
```

**Solution**: Single definition with re-exports
```rust
// sparky-core/src/lookup/constraint.rs
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct LookupConstraint {
    pub w0: Cvar, pub w1: Cvar, pub w2: Cvar, pub w3: Cvar,
    pub w4: Cvar, pub w5: Cvar, pub w6: Cvar,
}

// sparky-gates/src/lookup.rs
pub use sparky_core::lookup::LookupConstraint; // Re-export, no duplication
```

## Phase 5: WASM Layer Simplification (Week 3)

### 5.1 Remove Backup Implementations

**Target**: Clean WASM layer with single implementation strategy

**Current Mess**:
- `sparky-wasm/src/backup/` (3 backup implementations)
- `backup/bindings.rs` (563 lines) vs `bindings.rs` (647 lines)
- Multiple conversion strategies

**Cleanup Actions**:
1. **Delete** entire `sparky-wasm/src/backup/` directory
2. **Delete** `conversion_optimized.rs` (keep `conversion.rs`)
3. **Delete** redundant field operation implementations
4. **Standardize** on single WASM export strategy

### 5.2 Unify WASM Bindings

**Current Problem**: Field operations implemented in multiple places
```rust
// Both files implement same operations
// sparky-wasm/src/field.rs
pub fn field_add(x: JsValue, y: JsValue) -> JsValue { /* ... */ }

// sparky-wasm/src/bindings.rs  
pub fn fieldAdd(x: JsValue, y: JsValue) -> JsValue { /* ... */ }
```

**Solution**: Single source of truth
```rust
// sparky-wasm/src/bindings.rs (consolidate all WASM exports here)
pub use crate::field::{field_add as fieldAdd, field_mul as fieldMul};

// sparky-wasm/src/field.rs (implementation only, no direct exports)
pub fn field_add(x: JsValue, y: JsValue) -> JsValue { /* ... */ }
```

### 5.3 Standardize Error Handling

**Current Problem**: Inconsistent error handling across WASM boundary

**Solution**: Unified error conversion
```rust
// sparky-wasm/src/error.rs
pub fn sparky_result_to_js<T>(result: SparkyResult<T>) -> Result<JsValue, JsValue> 
where T: Into<JsValue> 
{
    match result {
        Ok(value) => Ok(value.into()),
        Err(SparkyError::FieldError(msg)) => Err(js_error(&format!("FieldError: {}", msg))),
        Err(SparkyError::ConstraintViolation(msg)) => Err(js_error(&format!("ConstraintViolation: {}", msg))),
        // ... handle all error types consistently
    }
}
```

## Phase 6: Gate Implementation Cleanup (Week 3-4)

### 6.1 Establish Clear Layer Separation

**Current Problem**: Same gate logic implemented at multiple levels

**Target Architecture**:
```
sparky-core/gates/     - Abstract gate definitions and constraint generation
sparky-gates/         - High-level gate implementations using core
sparky-wasm/gates.rs  - WASM bindings only, no logic
```

**Layer Responsibilities**:
- **Core**: Define gate types, constraint generation logic
- **Gates**: Implement specific gates (Generic, Poseidon, EC, etc.)
- **WASM**: Expose gates to JavaScript, no implementation logic

### 6.2 Standardize Gate Interface

**Target**: Consistent interface for all gate types
```rust
// sparky-core/src/gates/mod.rs
pub trait Gate {
    type Config;
    
    fn create_constraints(&self, config: &Self::Config, state: &mut SparkyState) -> SparkyResult<()>;
    fn num_constraints(&self) -> usize;
    fn gate_type(&self) -> &'static str;
}

// All gates implement this interface
impl Gate for GenericGate { /* ... */ }
impl Gate for PoseidonGate { /* ... */ }
impl Gate for EcGate { /* ... */ }
```

## Phase 7: Testing Infrastructure Unification (Week 4)

### 7.1 Consolidate Test Strategies

**Current Fragmentation**:
- `tests/` crate (integration tests)
- `sparky-examples/` (example-based testing)  
- Individual crate tests
- No unified strategy

**Target**: Unified testing approach
```
tests/
├── unit/           - Unit tests for each module
├── integration/    - Integration tests across modules  
├── examples/       - Example usage (moved from sparky-examples/)
├── benchmarks/     - Performance benchmarks
└── fixtures/       - Shared test data
```

### 7.2 Create Comprehensive Test Suite

**Focus Areas**:
1. **Field Operations**: Test all field arithmetic with edge cases
2. **Constraint Generation**: Verify constraints match expected format
3. **VK Parity**: Explicit tests comparing Sparky vs Snarky VK generation
4. **State Management**: Test state transitions and consistency
5. **WASM Integration**: Test JavaScript ↔ Rust boundary

## Phase 8: Memory Management Cleanup (Week 4)

### 8.1 Eliminate Memory Profiler Dependency

**Current Issue**: Separate `memory-profiler/` crate (527 lines) suggests memory problems

**Investigation Plan**:
1. Run memory profiler to identify actual leaks
2. Fix root causes instead of monitoring symptoms
3. Remove memory-profiler crate once issues are resolved

**Common Memory Issues in Rust**:
- Circular references with Rc/RefCell
- Forgetting to drop large allocations
- WASM memory not being freed properly

## UPDATED Success Metrics

### **CRITICAL**: Metrics adjusted based on current state deterioration

### Code Quality Metrics (**UPDATED BASELINES**)
- **Reduce codebase size by 35%** (eliminate ~405+ remaining lines of duplication - **895 lines already removed**)
- **Reduce warning count to <5** (currently 29 warnings - **improved from 100+**)
- **Address 15 remaining TODO items** (down from 37 - **verify these represent completed work**)
- **Zero circular dependencies** between modules
- **Remove 1 disabled/broken module** (`constraint_optimized.rs` - **new metric**)
- ✅ **WASM backup elimination: COMPLETED** (removed 895 lines of obsolete backup code)

### Architecture Quality (**SAME TARGETS, HIGHER URGENCY**)
- **Single field implementation** serving all use cases (**632+ lines to consolidate**)
- **Single constraint system interface** with no conflicts (**1,628 lines across 3 files to merge**)
- **Single run state management** with explicit ownership (**TLS split-brain unaddressed**)
- **Clear layer separation** between core, gates, and WASM
- ✅ **Zero backup implementations** in WASM layer (**3 backup files removed - 895 lines deleted**)

### Functional Improvements
- **Prepare infrastructure for VK parity fix** (reduce_lincom will be implemented separately)
- ✅ **Stable WASM builds** with no backup implementations needed (**completed - backup implementations removed**)
- **Deterministic constraint generation** with consistent structure
- **Comprehensive test coverage** for all critical paths
- **Fix disabled constraint optimization module** (**new requirement**)

### **NEW**: Regression Prevention Metrics
- **Constraint system code growth: 0%** (prevent further +57% explosions)
- **Failed experiment cleanup: 100%** (no disabled modules in main codebase)
- **Architectural debt ratio: <10%** (duplicate code / total code)

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Changes
1. **TLS Elimination**: Could break existing WASM integration
   - **Mitigation**: Implement explicit state passing incrementally
   - **Rollback**: Keep TLS wrapper as backup during transition

2. **Constraint System Merge**: Could introduce subtle bugs
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing before/after merge
   - **Rollback**: Keep original files until verification complete

3. **Field Unification**: Could break field-specific optimizations
   - **Mitigation**: Benchmark performance before/after changes
   - **Rollback**: Trait allows switching back to specialized implementations

### Testing Strategy
- **Before each phase**: Capture current test results and benchmarks
- **During implementation**: Run tests continuously with CI
- **After each phase**: Verify no regressions in functionality or performance

## Post-Cleanup Benefits

### Development Velocity
- **Faster feature development**: Single place to implement new functionality
- **Easier debugging**: Clear ownership and no hidden state
- **Simpler onboarding**: Clean architecture easier to understand

### Maintenance Burden
- **Reduced bug surface area**: Less duplicate code means fewer places for bugs
- **Consistent behavior**: Single implementation ensures consistent results
- **Clear upgrade path**: Well-defined interfaces make upgrades safer

### Performance Improvements
- **Reduced memory overhead**: No duplicate structures or double-wrapping
- **Better optimization**: Single implementation can be optimized thoroughly
- **Smaller WASM bundle**: No backup implementations or redundant code

## **CRITICAL CONCLUSION**

**The July 2025 reaudit reveals that cosmetic improvements (warning reduction, documentation) have masked the fact that core architectural problems have remained unchanged or gotten significantly worse.**

### **Key Findings**:
1. **Constraint system code grew +57%** without resolving split-brain architecture
2. **Field duplication unchanged** after months of development  
3. **TLS issues completely unaddressed** despite being identified as critical
4. **Failed experiments accumulating** as disabled code in the main codebase

### **Urgent Recommendation**:
**Stop all feature development and focus exclusively on architectural consolidation**. The current trajectory shows **technical debt accumulating faster than it's being resolved**.

**The original CLEANUP.md plan remains the correct approach, but execution is now CRITICAL for project viability**. Without immediate architectural intervention, Sparky risks becoming unmaintainable.

Success requires transforming Sparky from its current **fractured and degrading state** into a clean, maintainable implementation that can effectively compete with Snarky while maintaining the architectural clarity needed for long-term success.
