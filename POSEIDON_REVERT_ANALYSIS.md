# Poseidon Revert Analysis

## Summary
I methodically reverted the Poseidon changes from commit 31c3467c4, but the issue persists.

## Changes Reverted

### 1. src/bindings/sparky-adapter/poseidon-operations.ts âœ…
- Restored the original `flattenFieldVar` function that handles complex FieldVar expressions
- This function creates witness variables for Addition and Scale operations
- The simplified version in the commit was just returning fieldVar unchanged

### 2. Other files (not reverted as requested)
- gate-operations.ts - foreignFieldAdd changes kept
- types.ts - foreignFieldAdd type changes kept
- SPARKY_COMMIT - kept updated

## Test Results

After reverting and rebuilding:
- **Snarky**: Still fails with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '2')`
- **Sparky**: Still fails with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '2')`

## Conclusion

The Poseidon changes in commit 31c3467c4 were NOT the root cause of the issue. The problem persists even after reverting those changes.

## Next Steps

The real issue appears to be deeper - possibly in:
1. The proof verification logic itself
2. Changes to proof structure/format
3. Some other commit that modified core functionality
4. The 85 deleted test files might have been masking a pre-existing issue

The error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '2')` suggests code is trying to access index 2 of an undefined object during proof verification.
