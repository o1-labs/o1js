- **Implementation**: Worklist-based incremental processing with dependency tracking
- **Memory**: Efficient deferred constraint removal to avoid index shifting

### Advanced Compilation Analysis

**Current Focus**: The comprehensive test failures indicate advanced constraint generation differences between Snarky and Sparky backends for complex compilation scenarios.

**Root Cause**: While basic field operations achieve 100% parity, complex compilation patterns like:
- SmartContract method compilation with decorators
- ZkProgram recursive proof generation  
- Advanced cryptographic circuit compilation
- Complex constraint batching and optimization

These require deeper investigation of the constraint generation pipeline differences during advanced circuit compilation.

### Priority Development Order

1. **COMPLETED**: Infrastructure fixes (rangeCheck0, Poseidon, constraint bridge) ✅
2. **COMPLETED**: Algorithmic optimization overhaul (O(n²) → O(n log n)) ✅
3. **CURRENT**: Debug advanced SmartContract compilation failures  
4. **NEXT**: Investigate ZkProgram constraint generation differences
5. **FUTURE**: Optimize recursive proof and cryptographic circuit support

### Architecture Validation

**✅ Confirmed Working**:
- Backend switching infrastructure is robust and reliable
- WASM loading and initialization works correctly
- Parallel test infrastructure provides accurate isolated testing
- Field arithmetic operations achieve 100% parity between backends
- Memory management and process isolation work effectively
- Algorithmic optimizations provide massive performance improvements

**❌ Requires Implementation**:
- Advanced gate function bindings for complex circuits
