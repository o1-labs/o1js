## Executive Summary

**Sparky Status: ADVANCED PROTOTYPE WITH CRITICAL MATHEMATICAL INCOMPATIBILITY**

Sparky represents a sophisticated Rust-based constraint system backend with exceptional engineering quality and significant performance improvements over the existing Snarky OCaml implementation. The implementation demonstrates advanced architectural design with comprehensive testing infrastructure, backend isolation, and sophisticated optimization capabilities.

**Critical Limitation**: Despite architectural excellence, Sparky currently fails 100% of mathematical correctness tests (0/25 passing) due to permutation construction incompatibility with the Kimchi proving system. This renders Sparky unusable for production despite its technical merits.

**Performance Achievement**: When constraint generation succeeds, Sparky demonstrates 2-3x performance improvement over Snarky, while reducing constraint count by up to 4.1x through architectural optimizations.
