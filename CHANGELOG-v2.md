## [Unreleased](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/compare/1c736add...v2) - 2024-07-12

### Breaking Changes

- The `divMod32()` gadget was modified to accept `nBits` instead of `quotientBits`, and assert it is in the range [0, 2\*\*255) to address an issue previoulsy where the bound on `quotientBits` was too low https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1763.

- `Provable.equal()` now turns both types into canonical form before comparing them https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1759

  - Removed implicit version `Provable.equal(x, y)` where you didn't have to pass in the type

- `zkProgram` to support `auxiliaryOutput`

### Added

- New method `toCanonical()` in the `Provable<T>` interface to protect against incompleteness of certain operations on malicious witness inputs https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/pull/1759
