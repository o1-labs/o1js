## New Test Framework

### Core Components

#### 1. Backend Test Framework (`src/test/framework/backend-test-framework.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Provides systematic testing utilities for backend switching and comparison
- **Key Features**:
  - VK parity testing across multiple circuit patterns
  - Constraint system comparison and analysis
  - Backend routing infrastructure validation
  - Test circuit and program generators

#### 2. VK Parity Comprehensive Tests (`src/test/vk-parity-comprehensive.test.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Systematic verification key generation parity testing
- **Coverage**:
  - Basic circuit patterns (multiplication, addition, boolean logic)
  - ZkProgram compilation and VK generation
  - Edge cases (empty circuits, complex expressions)
  - Performance impact analysis
  - Comprehensive reporting

#### 3. Backend Infrastructure Tests (`src/test/backend-infrastructure.test.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Tests core backend switching mechanism and constraint routing
- **Coverage**:
  - Backend switching functionality
  - Global state management (globalThis.__snarky)
  - Constraint routing validation
  - Backend capability verification
  - Infrastructure health diagnostics

#### 4. Constraint System Analysis (`src/test/constraint-system-analysis.test.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Deep analysis of constraint generation and optimization differences
- **Coverage**:
  - Constraint structure comparison
  - Gate format compatibility
  - Optimization impact analysis (reduce_lincom)
  - Constraint scaling behavior
  - Recording infrastructure validation

### New Test Scripts

Added to `package.json`:

```bash
# Individual test suites
npm run test:vk-parity              # VK parity testing
npm run test:backend-infrastructure # Backend switching tests
npm run test:constraint-analysis    # Constraint system analysis

# Run entire new framework
npm run test:framework              # All consolidated tests
```

## Critical Issues Documented

### 1. Constraint Routing Bug
**Issue**: `globalThis.__snarky` is not updated when switching to Sparky backend
**Impact**: All constraints route through OCaml regardless of backend selection
**Result**: All Sparky VKs are identical, breaking VK parity

### 2. Optimization Differences
**Issue**: Missing `reduce_lincom` optimization in Sparky
**Impact**: Different constraint counts (e.g., Sparky: 5, Snarky: 3 for basic operations)
**Result**: VK hash differences even when routing is fixed

### 3. Infrastructure State
**Current Status**: All tests are designed to fail and document the broken state
**When Fixed**: Change test expectations from `false` to `true`

## Usage Guide

### Running VK Parity Tests
```bash
# Quick VK parity check
npm run test:vk-parity

# Expected output (current broken state):
# - All VK comparisons: ❌ (different hashes)
# - All constraint counts: ❌ (different counts)
# - Infrastructure issues: ❌ (routing bug detected)
```

### Running Infrastructure Diagnostics
```bash
# Check backend switching infrastructure
npm run test:backend-infrastructure

# Expected output (current broken state):
# - Backend switching: ✅ (works)
# - Global state management: ❌ (routing bug)
# - Constraint routing: ❌ (wrong backend)
```

### Running Constraint Analysis
```bash
# Analyze constraint generation differences
npm run test:constraint-analysis

# Expected output:
# - Constraint count differences documented
# - Optimization gaps identified
# - Gate format compatibility checked
```

### Running Complete Framework
```bash
# Run all consolidated tests
npm run test:framework

# Generates comprehensive report of all issues
```

## Future Maintenance

### When Routing Bug is Fixed
1. Update test expectations in all test files:
   - Change `expect(result.passed).toBe(false)` to `expect(result.passed).toBe(true)`
   - Remove "TODO" comments
   - Update documentation to reflect working state

2. Add performance benchmarking:
   - VK generation speed comparison
   - Constraint compilation time analysis
   - Memory usage profiling

### Adding New Test Cases
1. Use `BackendTestFramework` for consistent testing
2. Add to appropriate test suite (VK parity, infrastructure, or constraint analysis)
3. Follow existing patterns for systematic comparison

### Test Categories
- **VK Parity**: Focus on verification key generation consistency
- **Infrastructure**: Backend switching and routing mechanisms
- **Constraint Analysis**: Deep constraint system comparison
- **Performance**: Speed and efficiency comparisons (when routing fixed)

## Key Benefits

1. **Systematic Testing**: Replaced ad-hoc floating tests with comprehensive framework
2. **Issue Documentation**: All critical bugs are clearly documented and tested
3. **Future-Proof**: Tests will validate fixes and prevent regressions
4. **Clean Codebase**: Reduced 93 files to 4 organized test suites
5. **Preserved Knowledge**: Key diagnostic insights archived for reference

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Priority**: Fix the `globalThis.__snarky` routing bug
2. **Medium Priority**: Implement `reduce_lincom` optimization in Sparky
3. **Long-term**: Add performance parity validation
4. **Maintenance**: Update test expectations as issues are resolved

This cleanup provides a solid foundation for systematic VK parity validation and will automatically verify when the core infrastructure issues are resolved.
